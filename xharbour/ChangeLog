  * include/hbset.h
  * source/pp/pptable.c
  * source/rtl/set.c
  * source/rtl/traceprg.prg
    + Added support for:
       SET( _SET_TRACEFILE, <cFile> ) => cOldFile
       SET( _SET_TRACESTACK, <"NONE"|"CURRENT"|"ALL"> ) => cOldFile

  * source/rdd/nulsys/nulsys.prg
    + Added empty stubs needed to allow link of nulsys.lib in place of (rdd.lib + dbfntx.lib)

  * source/rtl/errorsys.prg
    * Modified log file logic to use macros to avoid forcing linkage of DB Functions (incase nulsys.lib is used).

2003-03-18 14:11 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>
  * source/vm/classes.c
    * Minor bug fixed.

  * include/classex.ch
    * Reverted recent incorrect change of Aug.

  * source/rtl/terror.prg
    * Default Severety to ES_ERROR in ErrorNew(...)

2003-03-18 21:32 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/regex.c
    ! HB_RegexSplit(), in case that the split token is not present
      in the string, returns an array of one item (the whole string).

  * tests/regex.prg
    + Added a test to demonstrate this feature.


2003-03-18 16:05 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  + source/rtl/hbreadini.prg
    + Added function HB_ReadIni( cFileSpec ) --> aaIniParsed

     This small procedure reads a .ini file into an associative array in
     the standard .ini format:
        ; A line starting with a ';' is a comment
        # Also, a '#' marks a comment up to the end of the line
        [NewSection]
        Variable = Value
        OtherVariable: Value

     You can pass a list of "potential" .ini files in a ';' separated path;
     the first readable file will be loaded.

     On error, the function returns NIL. On success, you will have an associative
     array of this form:

     { 'MAIN' => { 'Key1' => 'Val1', ... ,'KeyN' => 'ValN'},
       'Section1' => { 'Key1' => 'Val1', ... ,'KeyN' => 'ValN'},
       ...
       'SectionN' => { 'Key1' => 'Val1', ... ,'KeyN' => 'ValN'}
     }

     Main is the default section (variables that are declared without a section).

  * makefile.bc
  * makefile.vc
  * source/rtl/Makefile
    + Added compilation of hbreadini.prg

  + tests/parseini.ini
  + tests/parseini.prg
    + Test to demonstrate the woriking of ReadIni()

2003-03-18 12:42 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/regex.c
    % Optimization for non-group aware scans ( has/like operators
      and RegexSplit). Using "1" as maximum group matches, that makes
      core regex functions to stop when just found a first match.

2003-03-18 12:21 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/regex.c
    + Added function
         HB_RegexSplit( cRegEx, cStr [, bCaseInsens [, bMultiLine,
            [, nMax] ] ] ) --> aSplit
      This splits cStr (using cRegEx as a token) into aSplits. Each part of
      cStr that is separed by a string matching cRegEx is separated and put
      into a different element of aSplit.
      If nMax is given, a maximum of nMax elements are returned in the array,
      so you can have HB_RegexSplit( "=", "A test = A=B=C",,,2 ) that will
      return the array [ "A test ", " A=B=C" ].

      If cRegEx cannot be matched in cStr, HB_RegexSplit will return NIL.

  * tests/regex.prg
    + Added a test for HB_RegexSplit()


2003-03-18 01:35 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/inet.c
    ! Fixed async socket closing under linux. Now closing socket with InetClose
      will make also select() to return, and so functions waiting forever (as
      accept) will cleanly return.

2003-03-17 12:17 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>
  * source/rtl/win32ole.prg
    ! Fixed GPF when passing an OLE Object as paramater to an OLE Method.

2003-03-17 05:32 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * include/hbcompress.h
  * source/rtl/hbcompress.c
    - Removed zlib specific decl and memory management
    ! Using now hb_xgrab() family instead of malloc/calloc
      (also thread safe).
    % some code cleaning.

2003-03-16 14:17 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>
  * hrbdll.bc
  * source/rtl/regex.c
  * source/rtl/trace.c
    ! Fixed to allow creation of xHarbour DLL and DLL linked applications (BCC55)

2003-03-16 16:05 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/inet.c
    + Added InetStatus() function to get the status of a socket. Currently used
      to know if a socket is active (0) or closed (-1): TODO more status
    ! Put HB_STACK_LOCK/UNLOCK and HB_TEST_CANCEL_ENABLE_ASYN/ DISABLE in
      the right places. Now asynchronous killing of a thread waiting on a socket is
      working ( use KillThread()/jointhread )

  * source/rtl/trpc.prg
    ! Using cleaner cleanup of accepting tread, closing their sockets instead of killing
      them.

2003-03-16 13:56 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/thread.c
    + added internal function hb_getCurrentStackNoError() to find a stack
      or return null if stack were not present. hb_getCurrentStack() was
      primarily meant to be used by HB_VM_STACK macro and thus rose an
      error when called with an invalid th_id.

  * source/rtl/trpc.prg
  * source/rtl/trpccli.prg
    ! Using KillThraed() /JoinThread() combination instead of StopThread()
    ! Error in cyclic function decoding corrected.

2003-03-16 08:27 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * test/rpcclient.prg
    ! Removed InetInit() (is done by trpc).

  ! source/vm/inet.c
    ! Fixed UDP protocol recv.

2003-03-16 07:15 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * tests/mtcomplex.prg
    ! StopThread() is not anymore suitable to kill the monitor thread:
      changed to KillThread()

2003-03-16 06:53 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * vm/codebloc.c
  * vm/garbage.c
  * vm/hvm.c
    ! Important fixes made to various part of the code to avoid potential
      segfaults and deadlocks. The stack locking range has been increased,
      so GC can't take over i.e. returning functions or exiting codeblocks.

  * vm/thread.c
    ! Released stack before entering PRG mutex wait. That could cause deadlocks
      with fence idle actived.

  * rtl/console.c
    ! changed the order of stack/ hb_outputMutex locks

  * rtl/idle.c
    ! removed stack unlocking/locking that were guarding the GC collection. Now
      it is done in GC.

  + doc/xhbt_internals.txt
    + Added documentation on the internal programming of hb threads.

2003-03-15 20:17 UTC-0300 Walter Negro <anegro@overnet.com.ar>
   * contrib/mysql/mysql.c
     + Add function SQLERRNO() to obtain number of error.
       Code provided by Rui Caridade
   * contrib/mysql/tmysql.prg
     + Add method ErrorNo() to TMySqlQuery class to obtain
       number of error.
       Code provided by Rui Caridade.
     + Add method RecCount() to TMySqlQuery class.
       Code provided by Blue Face.

      it though), and added some optimizations for linux.

2003-03-14 12:20 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * include/thread.h
  * source/vm/thread.c
    + Added support for fenced idle routines under Linux.
    + Added PRG function ThreadIdleFence( [bMode] )--> bOldMode that
      queries or sets the idle fence.

  * source/vm/garbage.c
    * Now GC can be in fenced or unfenced mode under linux.

  * source/vm/hvm.c
    * The maximum count of instructions after wich the VM tests for cancelation
      is now defined in thread.h (HB_VM_UNLOCK_PERIOD).

  * source/rtl/console.c
    ! Fixed a bug in secure console locking.

  * tests/Makefile
    ! harbour is now searched in $HB_BIN_INSTALL

  * tests/mtgc.prg
    + Added a test for unfenced garbage collecting.

2003-03-13 16:29 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>

  * thread.h
    ! fixed linux compilation

2003-03-13 03:50 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * thread.h
  * thread.c
    ! Removed all compiation warnings (tnx Andy ;-)
    + Added async cancelation for threads in the new framework
      under windows.
    * Changed StopThread() behavior: under windows, it kindly
      requests the thread to terminate. Use KillThread() or
      KillAllThreads() to really interrupt a thread, and use
      KillThread( th ) / JoinThread( th ) to kill a thread and
      wait for cleanup functions to be completed. I could port
      this behavior also under linux, but since linux cancelation
      are safe, there is no need for a "kind" StopThread().
      Comments are welcome.

2003-03-12 16:51 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>
  * source/pp/ppcore.c

  * source/rtl/fstemp.c
    ! In linux, tmpname() issues a warining at link time. Usage of mkstemp()
      is FORCED instead (is also a MUCH MORE safe function, avoiding races
      and guess-the-temp-name vunlerability attacks).
      I am using it only on LINUX, but other UNIXes programmers might want
      to extend it's usage also on their systems.
      Also, that warning prevented scrips from detecting that link has
      been completed sucessfully.

   involved in the project, and to port the source to my windows test
   machines. Other programs, (involving classes, RDD and array management)
   are NOT going to work with this commit, because the develpement of the
   new framework has just started.

  * utils/hbmake/hbmake.prg
    ! Minor Fixes
    ! New options to Editor mode For Apps

2003-02-23 22:00 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/hbcompress.c
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    * removed warnings (not all on hbcompress: I have to review
      it all first).

  * makefile.bc
    + added crypt related files in RTL

  * tests/crypt.prg
    + added the canonical GetList local

2003-02-23 21:15 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/hbcompress.c
    - Removed adler32() checksum function, because...

  + source/rtl/hbchecksum.c
    + moved here adler32() function, with a new front end called
      HB_CHECKSUM( cStr ) -> nCheckSum32bit

  * source/rtl/trpc.prg
  * source/rtl/trpccli.prg
    + Added support for cyclic remote procedure call; now RPC can be
      called defining a for/next cluse or a foreach clause. The loop
      will be done in the server (there is no need to fill the network
      with operations: one request, one summary reply or all replies).

  * tests/rpcclient.prg
    + Added a test of foreach RPC call

  + source/rtl/hbhextonum.c

      functions allows only simmetric encryption with NXS algorithm, an
      algorithm provided by me; but the idea here is that HB_Crypt/HB_Decrypt
      SHOULD be frontend for all encription methods we may want to add.

      Currently:
         HB_Crypt( cData, cKey ) --> cCipher
         HB_Decrypt( cCipher, cKey ) --> cData
      In the future, there will be also space for cipher method.

    % Now thread is ALWAYS included if stack is included. If thread support
      is disabled, HB_MUTEX_LOCK() and HB_MUTEX_UNLOCK() are defined void,
      so there is no need to guard all calls to them in other files with
      #ifdef thread support.
    % Under linux, using system specific implementations of reentrant mutex.
      Other systems will still need the LightWeight Reentrant Mutexes,
      unless we implement specific reentrant pthread implementation for them
      (that is non-startard posix). I know both BSD and Darwin has reentrant
      mutexes.

  * source/rtl/hbrandom.c
    ! Strange, BCC continued to complain about it. Changed the name
      of the internal function from hb_random() to hb_random_num() and
      all went fine.
      Probably, the HB_FUNC macro has something do do with that.

     Use the function PadR() for the VarChar fields to be ended with blank
     space.
     Added the class function LOCATE. The bSoftSeek parameter must be used with
     a sorted field. I haven't fully test it. This function is not built for only
     sorted table. Perhaps an other function (like seek()) could be written for
     this (with a dicotomic search for example)? Any example of a search in a
     sorted table would be appreciated. Thanks

      using a blocking mutex at the beginning to make sure all
      creation rights are fulfilled. Also, the thread handle is not
      taken by the created thread (but taken in the creator) because
      there is the need of specific rights to open a thread handle

  * source/vm/thread.c
    ! malloc can be intrinsically thread unsafe (depending on os,
      but generally it is). For this reason, a global
      hb_allocMutex has been added on fm.c: this mutex is used to
      lock out sections in fm.c, but also to regulate all malloc(),
      realloc() and free() calls in MT programs. Thread.c is the
      first file revised, in the next hours I will lock all malloc
      calls, or translate them in hb_x...() calls.

  * tests/rpcclient.prg

  * source/common/hbtrace.c

2003-02-19 11:15 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    + Added LISP like array direct call to HB_ExecFromArray:
      HB_ExecFromArray( aArray )
      Where aArray must have one of the following formats:
      aArray := { @Func(), param1 .. paramN }
      aArray := { "FunctionName", param1 .. paramN }
      aArray := { oObject, "MethodName", param1 .. paramN }
      aArray := { oObject, nMethodID, param1 .. paramN }
      NOTE: HB_ExecFromArray() Returns the data returned by
      the called function or method.

  * include/hbclass.ch
    * fixed AddClsMethod name typo
    + added automatic constructor call with parameters throught Class Name
      oMyClass := TClass( "par1", par2, ... )
      is the same of
      oMyClass := TClass():New( "par1", par2, ... )
    + added Class Methods definition, but not finished
    + added CONSTRUCTOR / DESTRUCTOR definitions
    + added OVERRIDE optional parameter to METHOD syntax, only as an explicit word
      to remember that a method will be overrided in this class
    + added DYNAMIC parameter like Delphi syntax. Equivalent to VIRTUAL parameter.
  * source/rtl/tclass.prg
    + ConstructorCall() method added
      this automatically calls the object constructor if there are parameters passed
  + tests/clsctor.prg
    + test to demonstrate the new call syntax

  -------------------------------
  NOTE: Actually the only real change is the Class Name call with parameters
        others are little modifications that don't change actual programs.
        To use above new sintax you have to make a clean build.

2003-02-19 00:55 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    + Added function HB_ExecFromArray with the following syntax:

      HB_ExecFromArray( "FunctionName", aArray )
      HB_ExecFromArray( oObject, "MethodName", aArray )
      HB_ExecFromArray( oObject, nMethodID, aArray )
      The aArray elements are passed into the paramter list of the target
      function or methods.
      TODO --> return of the called function must be returened by this
      function, and also by HB_Exec function. Can someone lend me a

      HB_Serialize( Data )--> cSeralbuffer
      HB_Deserialize( cSerialbuffer )--> Data
      Can transform basic types into a string that can be
      safely stored on streams. It works also with arrays
      (and recursively!), but I have still not tested it
      with objects. Any way, the best way to serialize
      object is to use the HBPersistent interface.

  * source/rtl/regex.c
    + added function HB_RegexMatch, working like HB_Regex() but
      returning just .T. or .F. if match is achieved or not.
      This is to save garbage activity in releasing uneeded
      objects when you just have to know if a regex can be
      matched.

   * contrib/what32/source/_winsock.c
      + added #define _WINSOCKAPI_
      ! This prevents the inclusion of Winsock.h in Windows.h
      ! since Winsock2.h is already being included further down
      ! the list.
      ! RECVFROM
        _retni() was being called twice.  It appears to me that
        the intent was to return the result of recvfrom()

  * source/rtl/Makefile
  + source/rtl/hbcompress.c
    + Added compression routines based on a xharbour rearrangement
      of original (and free) zlib compression code.
      HB_COMPRESS( cSource [, nSourceLen ] ) --> cDest
      HB_COMPRESS( nComprFactor, cSource [,nSourceLen ] ) --> cDest
      HB_COMPRESS( cSource, nSourceLen, @cDest, @nDestLen ) --> nError
      HB_COMPRESS( nComprFactor, cSource, nSourceLen, @cDest, @nDestLen )
            --> nError

      HB_UNCOMPRESS( nDestLen, cSource [, nSourceLen ] ) --> cDest
      HB_UNCOMPRESS( nDestLen, cSource, nSourceLen, @cDest ) --> nError

      HB_COMPRESSERROR() --> nError
      HB_COMPRESSERRORDESC() -->cDesc
      HB_COMPRESSBUFLEN( nUncompressedLen )--> nDefaultBufLen

      There are some latest/minor fixes in memory allocation to
      be made, but the thing is working, and can only get better.
      Stream oriented incremental compression can also be achieved
      in the future (just wrapping the zlib a little more.

  * include/Makefile
  + include/hbcompress.h
    + RTL specific compilation headers

  + include/hbcompress.ch
    * PRG level definitions for usage with zlib. Not required, but
      useful (e.g. errror level meanings).

  + tests/compress.prg
    + A test for basic string compression functions

2003-02-11 02:30 UTC+0100 Przemyslaw Czerpak <druzus@polbox.com>
  * source/rtl/diskspac.c
    + added support for diskspace on UNIX platforms
      (first parameter is path if omitted "/" is checked)

  * source/rtl/seconds.c
    + new function added SECONDSCPU(n) which reports how many CPU and/or
      system seconds have elapsed since the beginning of the program execution.
      n == 1  utime  -> user CPU time of the current process
      n == 2  stime  -> system CPU time behalf of the current process
      n == 3  u + s  -> sum of utime + stime (default)
      n == 11 cutime -> sum of the user CPU time of the current + child process
      n == 12 cstime -> sum of the system CPU time of the current + child process
      n == 13 cu+cs  -> sum of cutime + cstime
      I have to ask someone similar with Windows to add support for this
      function. I found 'GetProcessTimes' in WIN API which can be used for
      NT based platforms but I cannot find anything for WIN 9X/ME.

  * source/pp/ppcore.c
    * allow to compile file with <CR><LF> on *nix platforms.
      It's dirty hack but works good for me and resolves one of the
      most important problem with common CLIPPER and Harbour
      (and other XBASE compatible compilers like FlagShip and CLIP)
      sources - only [x]Harbour cannot compile files with <CR>.

  * source/compiler/cmdcheck.c
    ! fix which allow to use file names with '-' char in '-o' option

  + bin/hb-mkslib
    + simple script which creates shared libraries for Linux for
    static ones (*.a) and/or object files (*.o).
