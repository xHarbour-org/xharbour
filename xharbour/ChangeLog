  * source/vm/hvm.c
    ! Fixed HB_P_FUNCTION, HB_P_FUNCTION, HB_P_SEND, and HB_P_SENDSHORT to be Thread Safe.

2003-01-02 07:28 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * include/inet.h
    ! Using winsock2 instead of winsock. Originarily, it was that way, but
      somehow this has been changed.

  * source/vm/thread.c
    + Now StartThread on method can be called both with a method pointer or

      or
        StartThread( oMyObject, "MethodName", ... )

  * tests/mttest.prg
    * Changed one of the StartThraed to show the "methodname" call.


2003-01-02 04:20 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * include/hbstack.h
    * Default compilation is now WITHOUT threads; -DHB_THREAD_SUPPORT
      must be specified for thread functions to be included.

  * include/thread.h
  * source/vm/thread.c
    * Changed grammar of StartThread Function as follow (all are
      alternatives)
        StarThread( @Function(), param1 ... paramN )
        StarThread( "Function_Name", param1 ... paramN )
        StarThread( {codeblock}, param1 ... paramN )

  * include/thread.h
    * Default HB_CRITICAL_LOCK for nonwindows systems has become Light
      Weight Reentrant Mutex
    * LWR lockinig Implemented as a macro
      (you should make clean after update)

  * source/rtl/console.c
    * Using HB_CRITICAL_LOCK for locking console, as it is now defined
      to be always reentrant.

  * source/vm/garbage.c
    * Using HB_CRITICAL_LOCK to lock GC, as it is now defined to be always
      reentrant.
    % Under linux, do not lock hb_gcGripGet/hb_gcGripDrop. This is a temporary
      hack:is working but we must find out why this lock causes deadlocks
      AND possibly sigsev, while removing it deadlock is gone and seg faults
      are far less. Under windows this to be working, so I left that alone.

  * source/vm/thread.c
    ! Now mutex at PRG level are working again: CreateMutex() LockMutex() etc
      are working again now.
    + Now StopThread() can be given an optional second parameter that is a
      mutex on which the target thread might be subscribing, so to release
      it more cleanly. Just a finesse, but is nice to have it.

  * tests/mtcomplex.prg
    * The second StopThread() has been updated to use the new grammar.
