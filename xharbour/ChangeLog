  * include/hbtrac.h
  * source/rtl/trace.c
    * removed my changes till I can better see what's wrong

2003-05-29 15:30 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>
  * source/rtl/trace.c
    - Uncommented code to create "trace.log" file and changed logic to reset the file if it exists.
  * source/rtl/traceprg.prg
    + Added logic to create Trace File if missing.
    * Refnied output format.

  * tests/pp.prg
    + Added logic to Save s_bArrayPrefix before calls to MatchRule() and Restore it if it failed.
    ! Fixed #translate rule for At( <what>, <where>, <from> ) for Clipper.
    ! Fixed NextToken() (prg version) handling of '' strings.
    ! Fixed #include logic to NOT conver filename to uppercase.
    + Added burned-in rules for "rp_dot.ch"
    + Added logic to use burned-in rules UNLESS "rp_dot.ch" is persent.

    /* pp once again functional when compiled with Clipper. */

  * tests/pp_harb.ch
    + Added SetArrayPrefix() interface.

2003-05-29 22:40 UTC+0200 Przemyslaw Czerpak <druzus@polbox.com>
  * xharbour/tests/pp.prg
    * some additional modification for running .prg files as script
      and to make pp working on *nix systems - '/' as as directory
      delimiter, ':' as a path separator
      _DEFAULT_INC_DIR macro added and passing parameters to .prg
      if pp is called pprun - now you can create a link 'pprun' to 'pp'
      and use it as a script interpreter.
      Ron, I hope I didn't break anything in PP with these changes.

  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtnul/gtnul.c
  * xharbour/xharbour.spec
    + new binary RPM with Ron's PP
    + new tools: xhbcc, xhbcmp, xhblnk and xhbmk, now you can
      specify GT during linking time by -gt<name> option. You don't
      have to add REQUEST HB_GT_<name> to your source code. The
      fallowing switches can be used:
        -o<outputfilename> # output file name
        -static         # link with static libs
        -shared         # link with shared libs (default)
        -mt             # link with multi-thread libs
        -gt<hbgt>       # link with <hbgt> GT driver, can be repeated to
                        # link with more GTs. The first one will be default
                        # on runtime

  * xharbour/include/hbextern.ch
    * some functions added to use it with PP
      I think the files wasn't updated for a long time. Maybe
      developers should add their new functions to them.

  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtcrs/gtcrs.c
    * some keys for XTERM4 added.

  * xharbour/source/rtl/trace.c
    * commented out the code which makes empty trace.log file if you
      run program linked with TRACELOG function. I have too many such
      empty files on my disk :-( - is it really necessary.

2003-05-28 26:20 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>
  * tests/pp.prg
    ! Fixed minor bug in CompilDefine() which mistakenly treated parentesized expression as a Psedu-Function.
    * Changed default action to RUN [-R] when Source File argument supplied (unless -P switch present).
    + Added support for Linux Type Association <#!> (guarded with #ifdef __PLATFORM_Linux).

      support is disabled - remeber that if set you shouldn't link
      your program with codepage lib.

2003-05-27 22:41 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>
  * include/hbexprc.c
  * source/compiler/harbour.sly
    ! Fixed support for WithData <operator>= Expression

2003-05-27 20:56 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>
  + include/hbvmprv.h
    + New header for definitions NOT shared with the Compiler.
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    - Removed definition for SYMBOLS and replace with #include "hbvmprv.h"
  * source/vm/runner.c
    - Removed duplicate definition for SYMBOLS and replace with #include "hbvmprv.h"

    + Added logic to utilize new pModuleSymbols Member of CLASS Structure to accept SAME MODULE access to ANY SCOPE.

  * tests/tstscope.prg
  + tests/scope1.prg
  + tests/scope2.prg
    * Modified to show Scoping Validation of MULTI-MODULE inter-crossed with INHERITANCE.
    /* Use:
         bld_b32 tstscope scope1 scope2
         bld_vc  tstscope scope1 scope2
    */

  * bin/bld.bat
    * Modified to allow 3 sources to be compiled and linked.

 /*
    NOTE: Finally we should have FULL SUPPORT for OOP Scoping as per standards established by current
          Leading Tools.

          As you may know, we never had support for a Module [Unit of compilation] scoping. This was
          a serious omission, and was a BIG hurdle in correctly addressing SCOPE problems with WHOO
          [and likely many other projects]. Well now xHarbour fully support compilation unit scoping
          so that when you have multiple classes that need access to PROTECTED Members of each other
          you may now place those classes in the SAME Module, and avoid the SCOPE issues that you'd
          otherwise encounter [unless you'd dismissed the required restricted SCOPEing. altogether.]

2003-05-27 22:07 UTC+0200 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/regex.c
    + Added HB_RegexAtx() function. It has the same grammar as
      HB_Regex, but it merges the functionality of Regex and Atx:
      the returned array is itself made of arrays containing the
      matched string, the start position of the match in the
      source string, and the end position. An entry is for the
      whole match, and the following are for the subgroups matches.

      The returned array has the form:
      { {WholeMatch, nStartWhole, nEndWhole },
        {Group1, nStartGroup1, nEndGroup1 },
        ...
        {GroupN, nStartGroupn, nEndGroupN }
      }
      ( for who does not remember, a "group" is an expression
        between parenthesis in a regex search pattern)
      RFC: the end position may be obtained with Len() + nStart
      but it seems to me it would be less efficient.

  * tests/regex.prg
    + Added a test for HB_RegexAtx()

2003-05-27 16:50 UTC-0300 Walter Negro <anegro@overnet.com.ar>
  * source/rtl/tbrowse.prg
    ! Fix logic to repositioning after to gobottom().
      Reported by Oscar Hernandez Suarez
    ! Evaluate skipblock with 0 in goto() for compatibilit with Clipper.

  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtcrs/gtcrs.c
  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtcrs/chrmap.c
  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtcrs/hb-charmap.def
    + now GTCRS is looking for screen map file in $HB_CHARMAP,
      $HB_ROOT/etc/harbour/hb-charmap.def, /etc/harbour/hb-charmap.def
      terminal name is taken from 'HB_TERM' or 'TERM' environment variable.
      If terminal name contains '/' character then is divided to subsections
      by this char and then each of them is included f.e.:
          export HB_TERM=linux/acsc/maz2iso
      means that sections :linux, :acsc, :maz2iso will be loaded.
      Remember that first subsection name (linux) will be used for terminfo
      initialization.

  * xharbour/source/codepage/cdpsrwin.c
    ! changed the codepage name to make the file linking with cdpruwin.c
      possible. This file is still bad - it's only copy of cdpruwin.c
      and Luiz has to upload the proper version of it.

2003-05-27 02:05 UTC-0500 Paul Tucker <ptucker@sympatico.ca>

  * contrib/rdd_ads/ads1.c
     * fixed logic for GoTo, to remove redundant code and numeric constants

     * Modified adsDeleted for speed and code standards.
       Recent fix to adsDeleted confused the RDD return value of SUCCESS
       and the Advantage-specific return value of AE_SUCCESS, which we
       cannot presume are the same--and certainly the error return
       codes are totally different.

2003-05-26 22:00 UTC-0300 Luiz Rafael Culik Guimaraes <culikr@uol.com.br>

      installed then takes current xHarbour sources from SourceForge CVS
      and build binaries RPMs at your local host
    To xHarbour www manger: Can you put this script somewhere on

    + New MULTI GT mode added. Now you can link your applications with
      more then one GT and choose it at runtime by switch //GT:<gtname>
      ex.:
        ./myprog //gt:sln
        ./myprog //gt:crs
        ./myprog //gt:pca
        ./myprog //gt:nul
      or by setting environment variables HB_GT=<gtname>
      to make xHarbour binaries with MULTI GT you have to set environment
      variable HB_MULTI_GT=yes
      then if you link your apps with static libraries you always have to
      link with gtnul and optionally with other gt libs you need.
      GTNUL is basic lib. It has to have all GT features. Other GTs may
      not have all function implemented on some platforms. My main idea
      was to allow developers adding platform specific GT extension without
      necessary of changing all GTs.
      I've tested it under Linux and it works correctly for:
      gtcrs, gtsln, gtpca, gtstd, gtcgi and gtnul (gt_tpl too ;-)).
      I added support for MULTI GT for gtwin too, but it has to be checked
      by someone who use Windows because now I cannot even compile it
      (I don't have windows access at this moment). I hope it'll work
      but maybe I made some typos.
      TODO:
        add MULTI GT support for gtdos, gtos2 and gtQTc. I have to ask
        developers to do that - it's rather hard for me because I don't
        use this platform. Now all the works is very easy - you only
        have to change all functions with hb_gt_ and hb_mouse_ prefixes
        to HB_GT_FUNC(gt_<...>) and HB_GT_FUNC(mouse_<...>) then
        add initialization code (see tail of gt_tpl.c)
      I've change a lot of code so It have to be intensively tested on
      different platforms.

  * source/rtl/trpc.prg
  * source/rtl/trpccli.prg
    % The RPC Syntax has been highly simplified on server side,
      Now the RPC function needs not to have been derived by
      the tRPCFunction class, but is just an executable object
      called by a HB_ExecFromArray() call. Also, while previous
      model required a special parameter decoding to be carried
      by RPC Function, in current model you can register any
      function, method or codeblock to be executed by the RPC
      server, with normal XHarbour parameter conventions.
      Finally, RPC function definitions (useful to send over
      internet what functions you have and what do they do)
      are now identical to canonical syntax defs in clipper,
      like i.e. MyFunc( C:10, A, NI ) --> L

  * tests/rpcserver.prg

2003-04-16 12:14 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/filesys.c
    ! convert_create_flags is now doing a more sensible work under unix.
      Default (FO_NORMAL) is translated into 666 (rw-rw-rw);
      FO_READONLY creates a r--r--r--, while FO_HIDDEN allows only the
      creator user to see (rw- or r--, depending on FO_READONLY) the
      file.
      Finally, FO_SYSTEM gives X attribute to all the fields with R
      attribute (e.g. r--r--r-- becomes r-xr-xr-x, and rw------- becomes
      rwx------).

      WARNING: convert_create_flags_ex has not been changed.

2003-04-16 10:35 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>

2003-04-14 01:51 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/inet.c
    ! EAGAIN error (retry later) was handled back to PRG
      program by InetAccept() as any other error, but
      InetAccept() model is made so that a prg can count on
      the facts that InetAccept() returns only if:
      1) there is a REAL error that requires PRG attention
      2) there is a timeout
      3) there is a valid connection
      So EAGAIN is now handled inside InetAccept looping while
      another error or a valid connection is taken.
    ! Now InetAccept returns NIL on failure, and the error is
      stored in the accepting socket.

  * samples/sitesvr/sitesvr.prg
    ! Removed HBConsoleLock() - it is "deprecated"

    ! Complete rewrite of main matching logic to fix long outstanding Clipper compatibility problems.

  /*
     NOTE: I wanted to fix this for the longest time, but for some reason really dreaded it. Pre-Processor
           was seriously NOT Clipper compatible regarding some critical issues that [likely] were not that
           common. But as I feared, with time, I got more and more reports of problems where a complete
           re-write of the matching engine was requires. Here are some of the more obvious examples of
           such problems:

              //---------------------------------------------
              #translate "hello" => Helloed()
              ? "hello"

              #translate KEY SUFFIX <x> => Correct( <x> )
              #translate SUFFIX <x> => Wrong( <x> )
              KEY SUFFIX "indeed"
              //---------------------------------------------

          Of course there were many similar variations. Well now after this rewrite the Pre-Processor should
          be MUCH more Clipper compatible. I've tested the new engine against full build of xHarbour as well
          full build of FiveHX, and many other tests, and all seems to work correctly, BUT since this is a
          major rewrite I'd like all developers to test this with all their applications before we release
          build 0.80.

  * include/set.ch
    ! Added _SET_TRACEFILE and _SET_TRACESTACK, and changed the

    ! Fixed a typo: used "|" instead of "||" in a test. Casually,
      result was the same.

  * source/rtl/hbreadini.prg
    + Added HB_WriteIni( cFile, aaIni [, cBeginComment [, cEndComment]])
            --> lResult
      If cFile is a string the file is created, while if it is a number
      (a file handler) an already open file is used. This is useful
      for writing by-hand some part of the config file and then pass

2003-03-18 16:05 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  + source/rtl/hbreadini.prg
    + Added function HB_ReadIni( cFileSpec ) --> aaIniParsed

     This small procedure reads a .ini file into an associative array in
     the standard .ini format:
        ; A line starting with a ';' is a comment
        # Also, a '#' marks a comment up to the end of the line
        [NewSection]
        Variable = Value
        OtherVariable: Value

     You can pass a list of "potential" .ini files in a ';' separated path;
     the first readable file will be loaded.

     On error, the function returns NIL. On success, you will have an associative
     array of this form:

     { 'MAIN' => { 'Key1' => 'Val1', ... ,'KeyN' => 'ValN'},
       'Section1' => { 'Key1' => 'Val1', ... ,'KeyN' => 'ValN'},
       ...
       'SectionN' => { 'Key1' => 'Val1', ... ,'KeyN' => 'ValN'}
     }

     Main is the default section (variables that are declared without a section).

  * makefile.bc
  * makefile.vc
  * source/rtl/Makefile
    + Added compilation of hbreadini.prg

  + tests/parseini.ini

2003-03-18 12:42 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/regex.c
    % Optimization for non-group aware scans ( has/like operators
      and RegexSplit). Using "1" as maximum group matches, that makes
      core regex functions to stop when just found a first match.

2003-03-18 12:21 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/regex.c
    + Added function
         HB_RegexSplit( cRegEx, cStr [, bCaseInsens [, bMultiLine,
            [, nMax] ] ] ) --> aSplit
      This splits cStr (using cRegEx as a token) into aSplits. Each part of
      cStr that is separed by a string matching cRegEx is separated and put
      into a different element of aSplit.
      If nMax is given, a maximum of nMax elements are returned in the array,
      so you can have HB_RegexSplit( "=", "A test = A=B=C",,,2 ) that will
      return the array [ "A test ", " A=B=C" ].

      If cRegEx cannot be matched in cStr, HB_RegexSplit will return NIL.

  * tests/regex.prg
    + Added a test for HB_RegexSplit()


2003-03-18 01:35 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/inet.c
    ! Fixed async socket closing under linux. Now closing socket with InetClose
      will make also select() to return, and so functions waiting forever (as
      accept) will cleanly return.

2003-03-17 12:17 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>
  * source/rtl/win32ole.prg

2003-03-16 16:05 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/inet.c
    + Added InetStatus() function to get the status of a socket. Currently used
      to know if a socket is active (0) or closed (-1): TODO more status
    ! Put HB_STACK_LOCK/UNLOCK and HB_TEST_CANCEL_ENABLE_ASYN/ DISABLE in
      the right places. Now asynchronous killing of a thread waiting on a socket is
      working ( use KillThread()/jointhread )

  * source/rtl/trpc.prg
    ! Using cleaner cleanup of accepting tread, closing their sockets instead of killing
      them.

2003-03-16 13:56 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/thread.c
    + added internal function hb_getCurrentStackNoError() to find a stack
      or return null if stack were not present. hb_getCurrentStack() was
      primarily meant to be used by HB_VM_STACK macro and thus rose an
      error when called with an invalid th_id.

  * source/rtl/trpc.prg
  * source/rtl/trpccli.prg
    ! Using KillThraed() /JoinThread() combination instead of StopThread()

  * vm/codebloc.c
  * vm/garbage.c
  * vm/hvm.c
    ! Important fixes made to various part of the code to avoid potential
      segfaults and deadlocks. The stack locking range has been increased,
      so GC can't take over i.e. returning functions or exiting codeblocks.

  * vm/thread.c
    ! Released stack before entering PRG mutex wait. That could cause deadlocks
      with fence idle actived.

  * rtl/console.c
    ! changed the order of stack/ hb_outputMutex locks

  * rtl/idle.c
    ! removed stack unlocking/locking that were guarding the GC collection. Now
      it is done in GC.

  + doc/xhbt_internals.txt

  * thread.h
  * thread.c
    ! Removed all compiation warnings (tnx Andy ;-)
    + Added async cancelation for threads in the new framework
      under windows.
    * Changed StopThread() behavior: under windows, it kindly
      requests the thread to terminate. Use KillThread() or
      KillAllThreads() to really interrupt a thread, and use
      KillThread( th ) / JoinThread( th ) to kill a thread and
      wait for cleanup functions to be completed. I could port
      this behavior also under linux, but since linux cancelation
      are safe, there is no need for a "kind" StopThread().
      Comments are welcome.

           ('[]' operator) with the Property Name as the INDEX.

2003-02-23 22:00 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/hbcompress.c
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    * removed warnings (not all on hbcompress: I have to review
      it all first).

  * makefile.bc
    + added crypt related files in RTL

  * tests/crypt.prg
    + added the canonical GetList local

2003-02-23 21:15 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/rtl/hbcompress.c
    - Removed adler32() checksum function, because...

  + source/rtl/hbchecksum.c
    + moved here adler32() function, with a new front end called
      HB_CHECKSUM( cStr ) -> nCheckSum32bit

  * source/rtl/trpc.prg
  * source/rtl/trpccli.prg
    + Added support for cyclic remote procedure call; now RPC can be
      called defining a for/next cluse or a foreach clause. The loop
      will be done in the server (there is no need to fill the network
      with operations: one request, one summary reply or all replies).

  * tests/rpcclient.prg
    + Added a test of foreach RPC call

  + source/rtl/hbhextonum.c
    + Added functions
      HB_HexToNum( cHexString )--> nNum
      HB_NumToHex( nNum ) --> cHexString

  * include/Makefile
  + include/hbnxs.h
  * source/rtl/Makefile
  + source/rtl/hbcrypt.c
    + Added HB_Crypt() and HB_Decrypt() functions. At the moment, this two
      functions allows only simmetric encryption with NXS algorithm, an
      algorithm provided by me; but the idea here is that HB_Crypt/HB_Decrypt
      SHOULD be frontend for all encription methods we may want to add.

      Currently:
         HB_Crypt( cData, cKey ) --> cCipher
         HB_Decrypt( cCipher, cKey ) --> cData
      In the future, there will be also space for cipher method.

  + tests/crypt.prg

    ! hb_allocMutex was not initialized if statistics were off.

  * source/vm/garbage.c
    * minor style fixes

  * source/vm/thread.c
    * Added function KillAllThreads() to terminate all waiting
      threads from inside the .prg program (i.e. a error
      detection routine).

  * tests/mtcomplex.prg
    + Added a KillAllThreads() test
    * Visual upgrade

  * config/gcc.cf
    + ADDED -DHB_OS_LINUX to better identify linux specific extensions
    - REMOVED "-g" (debug) switch from default compilation. You will have
      to add it to CUSR to have this in.

  * include/hbsetup.h
    + Added #ifdef HB_OS_LINUX --> #define HB_OS_UNIX

  * include/hbstack.h
  * include/thread.h
    % Now thread is ALWAYS included if stack is included. If thread support
      is disabled, HB_MUTEX_LOCK() and HB_MUTEX_UNLOCK() are defined void,
      so there is no need to guard all calls to them in other files with
      #ifdef thread support.
    % Under linux, using system specific implementations of reentrant mutex.
      Other systems will still need the LightWeight Reentrant Mutexes,
      unless we implement specific reentrant pthread implementation for them
      (that is non-startard posix). I know both BSD and Darwin has reentrant
      mutexes.

    ! Strange, BCC continued to complain about it. Changed the name
      of the internal function from hb_random() to hb_random_num() and
      all went fine.
      Probably, the HB_FUNC macro has something do do with that.

2003-02-22 02:30 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>

  * tests/mtgc.c
    + Added more extensive stress tests that have allowed the detection
      of the above problem.

     Tests on long AND short date format (I only do it on BRITICH format)
     Use the function PadR() for the VarChar fields to be ended with blank
     space.
     Added the class function LOCATE. The bSoftSeek parameter must be used with
     a sorted field. I haven't fully test it. This function is not built for only
     sorted table. Perhaps an other function (like seek()) could be written for
     this (with a dicotomic search for example)? Any example of a search in a
     sorted table would be appreciated. Thanks
     bof() eof() gobottom() gotop() skip() working properly now

2003-02-20 02:35 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/thread.c
    ! Under windows, instead of using suspended creation of threads,
      using a blocking mutex at the beginning to make sure all
      creation rights are fulfilled. Also, the thread handle is not
      taken by the created thread (but taken in the creator) because
      there is the need of specific rights to open a thread handle
      under windows 2000/xp

2003-02-20 01:30 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>

  * samples/sitesvr/sitesvr.prg
    ! Removed some test code and added some mutexes for increased
      stability.

  * source/rtl/trpc.prg
    + Added callbacs in the server code, so final application can
      monitor connection(s) status.
    % Now thread servicing client connections is encapsulated in his
      own class
    * Code for encription has been put in place; an encription back
      end will be soon added

  * source/rtl/trpccli.prg
    ! minor fixes

  * source/vm/fm.c
  * source/vm/thread.c
    ! malloc can be intrinsically thread unsafe (depending on os,
      but generally it is). For this reason, a global
      hb_allocMutex has been added on fm.c: this mutex is used to
      lock out sections in fm.c, but also to regulate all malloc(),
      realloc() and free() calls in MT programs. Thread.c is the
      first file revised, in the next hours I will lock all malloc
      calls, or translate them in hb_x...() calls.

  * tests/rpcclient.prg
    * Minor stylistic fixes

  * tests/rpcserver.prg
    + Implementation of the new callbacks


2003-02-19 17:50 UTC+0100 Ian Anderson <ianderson@procon-online.de>
  * make_b32.bat

    lines

2003-02-19 17:30 UTC+0100 Ian Anderson <ianderson@procon-online.de>
  * source/common/hbtrace.c
    ! HB_TRACELEVEL() now works as documented in tracing.txt
    hb_tracelevel() was setting the wrong variable for the trace
    level, and hb_tr_trace() was not testing correctly to see if the
    trace should be displayed at the current level setting

2003-02-19 13:14 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/hvm.c

  * source/vm/classes.c
  * source/vm/thread.c
  * include/hbstack.h
    ! Current selected method was stored in a static module variable.
      This practice was not thread safe, and I have moved the s_pMethod
      variable into the stack.
      THIS REQUIRE MAKE CLEAN IN ORDER TO WORK, or (probably) any
      application using classes could crash.


2003-02-19 11:15 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    + Added LISP like array direct call to HB_ExecFromArray:
      HB_ExecFromArray( aArray )
      Where aArray must have one of the following formats:
      aArray := { @Func(), param1 .. paramN }
      aArray := { "FunctionName", param1 .. paramN }
      aArray := { oObject, "MethodName", param1 .. paramN }
      aArray := { oObject, nMethodID, param1 .. paramN }
      NOTE: HB_ExecFromArray() Returns the data returned by
      the called function or method.

  * tests/exec.prg
    + test to demonstrate this new features

2003-02-19 03:03 UTC+0100 Francesco Saverio Giudice <info@fsgiudice.com>
  * include/hbclass.ch
    * fixed AddClsMethod name typo
    + added automatic constructor call with parameters throught Class Name
      oMyClass := TClass( "par1", par2, ... )
      is the same of
      oMyClass := TClass():New( "par1", par2, ... )
    + added Class Methods definition, but not finished
    + added CONSTRUCTOR / DESTRUCTOR definitions
    + added OVERRIDE optional parameter to METHOD syntax, only as an explicit word
      to remember that a method will be overrided in this class
    + added DYNAMIC parameter like Delphi syntax. Equivalent to VIRTUAL parameter.
  * source/rtl/tclass.prg
    + ConstructorCall() method added
      this automatically calls the object constructor if there are parameters passed
  + tests/clsctor.prg
    + test to demonstrate the new call syntax

  -------------------------------
  NOTE: Actually the only real change is the Class Name call with parameters
        others are little modifications that don't change actual programs.
        To use above new sintax you have to make a clean build.


2003-02-18 18:06 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>
  * source/compiler/harbour.sly
    ! Fixed imporoper generation of HB_ResetTry() portion of TRY syntax.

2003-02-19 00:55 UTC+0100 Giancarlo Niccolai <gian@niccolai.ws>
  * source/vm/hvm.c
    + Added function HB_ExecFromArray with the following syntax:
      HB_ExecFromArray( @Func(), aArray )
      HB_ExecFromArray( "FunctionName", aArray )
      HB_ExecFromArray( oObject, "MethodName", aArray )
      HB_ExecFromArray( oObject, nMethodID, aArray )
      The aArray elements are passed into the paramter list of the target
      function or methods.
      TODO --> return of the called function must be returened by this
      function, and also by HB_Exec function. Can someone lend me a
      hand here?

    + Fixed a bug in serialization of nested arrays
    + HB_CreateLen8() can now create the 8 bytes system independent
      lenght field both on the fly (returning a raw string) and
      operating on a pre-built string.
      HB_CreateLen8( nLongInt ) -->cSysUndepNumber
      HB_CreateLen8( @cSysUndepNumber, nLongInt ) --> NIL

  + tests/serialize.prg
    + Added a test (and demo) for serialization and deserialization.

  * source/rtl/Makefile
  + source/rtl/trpccli.prg
  + source/rtl/trpc.prg
    + Added XHARBOUR specific class oriented Remote Procedure Call
      support (server and client side). This is HIGHLY experimental
      and in the CVS just to let the developers to have a preview at
      this. Have FUN :-)

  * source/rtl/Makefile
  + source/rtl/hbserial.prg
  + source/rtl/hbsrlraw.c
    ! Added basic datatype serialization: the functions
      HB_Serialize( Data )--> cSeralbuffer
      HB_Deserialize( cSerialbuffer )--> Data
      Can transform basic types into a string that can be
      safely stored on streams. It works also with arrays
      (and recursively!), but I have still not tested it
      with objects. Any way, the best way to serialize
      object is to use the HBPersistent interface.

  * source/rtl/regex.c
    + added function HB_RegexMatch, working like HB_Regex() but
      returning just .T. or .F. if match is achieved or not.
      This is to save garbage activity in releasing uneeded
      objects when you just have to know if a regex can be
      matched.

    * Buffer created on the fly for compression is now a little bigger,
       for safety. We will reduce it again if we see that this is fine.

  * source/rtl/Makefile
  + source/rtl/hbcompress.c
    + Added compression routines based on a xharbour rearrangement
      of original (and free) zlib compression code.
      HB_COMPRESS( cSource [, nSourceLen ] ) --> cDest
      HB_COMPRESS( nComprFactor, cSource [,nSourceLen ] ) --> cDest
      HB_COMPRESS( cSource, nSourceLen, @cDest, @nDestLen ) --> nError
      HB_COMPRESS( nComprFactor, cSource, nSourceLen, @cDest, @nDestLen )
            --> nError

      HB_UNCOMPRESS( nDestLen, cSource [, nSourceLen ] ) --> cDest
      HB_UNCOMPRESS( nDestLen, cSource, nSourceLen, @cDest ) --> nError

      HB_COMPRESSERROR() --> nError
      HB_COMPRESSERRORDESC() -->cDesc
      HB_COMPRESSBUFLEN( nUncompressedLen )--> nDefaultBufLen

      There are some latest/minor fixes in memory allocation to
      be made, but the thing is working, and can only get better.
      Stream oriented incremental compression can also be achieved
      in the future (just wrapping the zlib a little more.

  * include/Makefile
  + include/hbcompress.h
    + RTL specific compilation headers

  + include/hbcompress.ch
    * PRG level definitions for usage with zlib. Not required, but
      useful (e.g. errror level meanings).

  + tests/compress.prg
    + A test for basic string compression functions

  * source/rtl/diskspac.c
    + added support for diskspace on UNIX platforms
      (first parameter is path if omitted "/" is checked)

  * source/rtl/seconds.c
    + new function added SECONDSCPU(n) which reports how many CPU and/or
      system seconds have elapsed since the beginning of the program execution.
      n == 1  utime  -> user CPU time of the current process
      n == 2  stime  -> system CPU time behalf of the current process
      n == 3  u + s  -> sum of utime + stime (default)
      n == 11 cutime -> sum of the user CPU time of the current + child process
      n == 12 cstime -> sum of the system CPU time of the current + child process
      n == 13 cu+cs  -> sum of cutime + cstime
      I have to ask someone similar with Windows to add support for this
      function. I found 'GetProcessTimes' in WIN API which can be used for
      NT based platforms but I cannot find anything for WIN 9X/ME.

  * source/pp/ppcore.c
    * allow to compile file with <CR><LF> on *nix platforms.
      It's dirty hack but works good for me and resolves one of the
      most important problem with common CLIPPER and Harbour
      (and other XBASE compatible compilers like FlagShip and CLIP)
      sources - only [x]Harbour cannot compile files with <CR>.

  * source/compiler/cmdcheck.c
