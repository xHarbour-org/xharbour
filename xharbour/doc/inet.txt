 *      
 *      
 *      This is just a draft, a survival guide with minimal API instructions

 *      the xharbour newsgroup.
 *      
 *      More adequate version will be available soon.

 *      
 *      XHARBOUR INET API
 *      =================
 *      
 *      
 *      Startup / cleanup functions
 *      ---------------------------
 *      
 *      InetInit() -->NIL
 *        Activates inet support; mainly used for winsock start up at the moment, but
 *        could be used in the future for many other purpose. Put it at the beginning
 *        of every program using INET functions.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetCleanup() -->NIL
 *        Closes Inet support; mainly used for win32. Put it at the end of any program
 *        using Inet functions, just before program exits.
 *      
 *      InetCreate() --> SOCKET
 *        Creates the raw data of the socket, that can be passed to an asynchronoys
 *        connection function (InetConnect or InetConnectIP). This will prevent the
 *        connection function to allocate some data that could be never used on
 *        certain case, i.e. an asynchronously detected timeout.
 *      
 *      InetClose( SOCKET ) --> NUMERIC
 *        Closes the socket, notifiying both ends of the communication pipe that the
 *        connection is over. If you have threads waiting for data to be read from
 *        this socket, this method will make them to stop waiting and return an error
 *        (socket closed) to their callers.
 *        The method does not destroys the socket, that can be used by subordinate
 *        threads to check that the socket is closed, and so they should stop as soon
 *        as they can. Don't destroy the socket unless you are sure that no other
 *        thread is using it.
 *        RETURNS 0 on success or -1 on error; on error, the error code is set;
 *        (actually, on success the socket error code is set to 1 -- socket closed )
 *      
 *      
 *      InetDestroy( SOCKET ) --> Numeric
 *        Closes AND destroys a socket. After this call, the socket can't be used
 *        anymore. Returns 0 on success -1 on failure.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetSetTimeout( SOCKET, nMillisecs ) --> NIL
 *        Sets the default timeout of the given socket. Default timeout is used in all
 *        blocking operations: if the operation can't be done in nMillisec milliseconds,
 *        the function returns immediately and the InetErrorCode( SOCKET ) returns -1.
 *        The default timeout is not the maximum time that a function using the socket
 *        is allowed to execute: it is the maximum time that each single blocking
 *        operation inside that function is allowed to hold the control of the socket.
 *        So, an function like InetReadAll(), that may repeat a raw recv() several
 *        times, is not guaranteed to terminate in nMillisecs, but you are guaranteed
 *        that if any of that raw socket read operation is going to take more than
 *        nMillisecs, the function will be terminated.
 *        When created, a socket is created with an infinite default timeout (-1).
 *      
 *      InetGetTimeout( SOCKET ) --> NUMERIC
 *        Returns the timeout set for the given socket.
 *      
 *      InetClearTimeout( SOCKET, nMillisecs ) --> NIL
 *        Clears the default timeout of the given socket. Default timeout is used in all
 *        blocking operations.
 *      
 *      
 *      Informative functions
 *      ---------------------
 *      
 *      InetErrorCode( SOCKET ) --> Numeric
 *        Returns the last error code that has been provoked by a network operation,
 *        or 0 if none. Error codes are the one used for winsock or UnixSockets (they
 *        are the same); 1 is reserved for "connection closed" message.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetErrorDesc( SOCKET ) --> String
 *        Returns a string describing the last error that have occoured to the socket;
 *        the string is system dependent, and should be used only for debugging
 *        purposes.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetCount( SOCKET ) --> Numeric
 *        Returns the amount of characters read or written in the latest socket
 *        operation.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetAdderss( SOCKET ) --> STRING
 *        Returns a string representing the remote server addres in quad dot notation,
 *        e.g. "192.168.1.1", or the local server address if the socket is server
 *        side.
 *        TODO: have a version that returns a vector of 4 numbers.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetPort( SOCKET ) --> STRING
 *        Returns the port to which this socket is bound, or the remote port if this
 *        socket is connected with a remote host or client
 *      
 *      Server Side socket functions
 *      ----------------------------
 *      
 *      InetServer( port [, cBindAddr [, nListenLimit]]  ) --> SOCKET
 *        Creates a server that can accept connections from client on a certain port.
 *        If the computer on which InetServe is called has more than one logical
 *        interface (e.g. one network card, one loopback and one PPP address),
 *        cBindAddr can be specified to select only one of this interface to accept
 *        connections for this process. This is useful when a server is present on
 *        two networks, and the service is to be available only in one of them. Also,
 *        the same port on other addresses is left free to be used, so you can have
 *        different server programs running for different networks but managing
 *        the same service. In example, an FTP server available to the internal
 *        network could be radically different from an FTP server available for
 *        the internet.
 *        nListenLimit is an internal parameter and rarely needs to be specified.
 *        This is the number of incoming connections accepted by kernel before the
 *        kernel has the chance to report them to the application program. If
 *        the sockets receives nListenLimit connection before accepting them
 *        all, the nListenLimit + 1 connecion will be notified to be "busy" by
 *        the kernel. Usually,  a value of 10 (the default) is enough for even
 *        heavy duty server.
 *        On error, sets error description in the newly returned socket.
 *      
 *      InetAccept( SOCKET ) --> SOCKET
 *        Waits until a connection is available on a socket created with InetServer;
 *        Returns a socket that can be used to communicate with the incoming client.
 *        On error, sets error in the newly returned socket.
 *      
 *      Client side socket functions
 *      ----------------------------
 *      
 *      InetConnect( cAddress, nPort ) --> SOCKET
 *      InetConnect( cAddress, nPort, SOCKET ) --> NIL
 *        Connects to a remote server described by cAddress, that can be in
 *        quad dot notation (e.g. "192.168.1.1") or in DNS name (e.g.
 *        "www.xharbour.org"), using the desired port.
 *        InetConnect uses "gethostbyname" C system call to
 *        find the network address of the specified server; this means that
 *        this call is an hybrid function doing both a DNS scan and a TCP/IP
 *        connection. InetConnect is not thread safe, and the xHarbour
 *        program must take care that two InetConnect functions are never
 *        called at the same moment from two different threads (or that
 *        InetGetHosts is not called in the same moment as an InetConnect).
 *        The second version of this functions accepts a pre-built socket
 *        as parameter. This allows to kill asyncronously a thread waiting
 *        for InetConnect to connect, and then cleaning up the leftover
 *        socket data. Also, it is possible to give timeout to the given SOCKET,
 *        but this timeout will be used only in the connection phase, after that
 *        the network address resolution is completed. Use GetHosts() and
 *        InetConnectIP for a finer timeout control.
 *        On error, the error of the returned socket is set. The error could
 *        be due to unavailable name resolving service, host name not valid,
 *        host address not reachable and host reachable but port not open.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetConnectIP( cAddress, PORT ) --> SOCKET
 *      InetConnectIP( cAddress, PORT, SOCKET ) --> NIL
 *        Connects to a remote server described by cAddress, that can be specified
 *        only in quad dot IPV4 notation (e.g. "127.0.0.1"), using the desired port.
 *        This version of InetConnect does not use gethostbyname, and thus is thread
 *        safe and can be used in combination with InetGetHosts to have a finer
 *        timeout control while connecting to a server, and a finer error control.
 *        The second version of this functions accepts a pre-built socket
 *        as parameter. This allows to kill asyncronously a thread waiting
 *        for InetConnectIP to connect, and then cleaning up the leftover
 *        socket data. Also, it is possible to give timeout at the given SOCKET.
 *      
 *        On error, the error of the returned socket is set.
 *      
 *      
 *      
 *      Sening and receiving data
 *      ----------------------------
 *      
 *      InetRecv( SOCKET, @cString [, nAmount] ) --> NUMERIC
 *        Reads at maximum nAmount bytes (or a number of bytes equal to cString
 *        length if nAmount is not given) from the socket into cString.
 *        The parameter cString must be preallocated so that it has enough
 *        space to receive the data. The routine will block the thread until some
 *        bytes are read from the socket, the socket is closed (either from the
 *        receiver or the sender side)or a network error occours, wichever comes
 *        first. In the latter cases, an error is set, and only the characters
 *        received until premature end of communications are returned.
 *        Notice that there is no guarantee that all the available bytes will be
 *        read before the function returns, in fact, InetRecv returns as soon it
 *        is able to fill cString with one or more bytes. To block the current
 *        process until the whole cString is filled (or nAmuount bytes are read),
 *        use the InetRecvALL().
 *        RETURNS the number of the characters read from the SOCKET.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetRecvAll( SOCKET, @cString [, nAmount] ) --> NUMERIC
 *        This function works exaclty as InetRecv, except for the fact that it
 *        blocks untill nAmount bytes are read, if nAmount is given, or
 *        cString is filled for it's whole lenght.
 *        RETURNS the number of the characters read from the SOCKET. Might be
 *        less than nAmount on premature socket closing or on network error.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetRecvLine( SOCKET [, @nResult, [, nMaxLength [, nBufSize]]] ) --> STRING
 *        Blocks the calling thread until a sequence CRLF is read from the socket.
 *        Incremental allocation and end-of-line checking are done in an efficient
 *        way. If an error occours, or if the stream is closed before a CRLF is read,
 *        the functions returns nothing and sets the socket error.
 *        The returned string does not contains the trailing CRLF sequence, so an
 *        empty line is effectively returned as an empty string.
 *        If the nResult parameter is given, it will contain the number of bytes
 *        read from the socket, including the CRLF sequence, so that in normal
 *        conditions, nResult will report a count equal to the lenght of the
 *        returned string plus 2. nResult will be 0 if stream is closed before
 *        a CRLF sequence is read, and will be -1 on error.
 *        An optional MaxLength parameter can be given to allow a maximum character
 *        count before the data is returned any way. If this number is hit before
 *        a CRLF sequence is encountered, nResult will contain the value one.
 *        Finally, a nBufSize parameter can be given. If not, memory allocation
 *        will be increased by discrete amounts of 80 bytes. The programmer
 *        can provide here a different allocation strategy (e.g. setting nBufSize
 *        equal to nMaxLenght, memory for reading the line will be allocated only
 *        once, at the beginning of the function).
 *      
 *      
 *      InetRecvEndBlock( SOCKET [, cBlock [, @nResult, [, nMaxLength [,
 *             nBufSize]]]] ) --> STRING
 *        This functions operates exactly the same way as InetRecvLine, but
 *        the "record termination" is customizable thorugh the cBlock parameter.
 *        If not given, this parameter defaults to the CRLF sequence.

 *      
 *      
 *      InetDataReady( SOCKET [, nMillisecs] ) --> NUMERIC
 *        Verifies if some data is available to be read in the socket without blocking
 *        execution of the caller. If nMillisecs is not given, the functions returns
 *        immediately 1 if there is some data to be read, 0 if there isn't any data and
 *        -1 in case of error. If nMillisecs is given, the functon will wait up to that
 *        amount of milliseconds for data to be available; if some data arrives in the
 *        meanwhile, the wait is immediately interrupted.
 *        The next InetRecv() function will read all the available data (up to the
 *        reqired lenght) without blocking.
 *        On error, InetErrorCode and InetErrorDesc can be use to determine what kind
 *        of error happend.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetSend( SOCKET, STRING [, nLength ] ) --> NUNERIC
 *        Send data being stored in a string over the socket. Returns the amount of
 *        data written, 0 if the socket has been closed in the meanwhile or -1 on
 *        error. nLenght aparameter can be given to allow writing only a part of
 *        the string.
 *        Please, notice that there is no guarantee that all your string will be
 *        sent, as this is a decision that is up to the OS; this function does not
 *        takes care to ensure that the data is really sent; so you should check for
 *        the returned number, and send the part that has not been sent.
 *        To ensure that all the data is sent before the function returns, use the
 *        InetSendAll() function.
 *        On error, the error in the socket is set.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetSendAll( SOCKET, STRING [, nLength ] ) --> NUNERIC
 *        This function works exactly as InetSend() but it ensures that all the
 *        data to be sent is written before returning.
 *      
 *      Utitlity Functions
 *      ------------------
 *      
 *      InetGetHosts( cName ) --> aHosts
 *        Returns an array containing all the IP addresses associated with a given
 *        host name. The IP addressess returned by this funtions are strings in
 *        quad dot notations, eg "192.168.1.1", and can be directly used into
 *        InetConnectIP(). cName can be any string: valid DNS names (eg.
 *        "www.myserver.com"), locally available names (e.g. "localhost" or
 *        windows Network Neighborhood names), or even IP addresses in quad
 *        dot notation.
 *        NOTE: This function is not thread safe (by desing), and programmers
 *        must be sure not to use it at the same time in two different threads,
 *        or not to use it together with a InetConnect(). If this kind of situation 
 *        should ever arise, you are advised to use a thread MUTEX.
 *        On error, and if the server can't be found, the function returns NIL.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetGetAlias( cName ) --> aHosts
 *        Returns an array containing the aliases ( CNAME DNS records ) by
 *        which the server is currently known. Wether this function is able
 *        to have the complete list of alias or not depends on the verbosity
 *        of the DNS server.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetCRLF() --> String
 *        Returns a CRLF sequence used in many internet protocols.
 *      
 *      UDP (User Datagram Protocol) Compliant Routines
 *      -----------------------------------------------
 *      
 *      InetDGram( [bBroadcast] ) --> SOCKET
 *        Creates a datagram oriented socket that will be able to send data and
 *        eventually receive data. Since the socket is not bound, the program can't
 *        retrieve the address at wich this socket appares to be, but a second
 *        socket receiving a message sent from this one would be able to reply
 *        correctly with a datagram that can be read from a non-bound socket.
 *        If bBroadcast is set to .T., the routine creates a broadcast capable socket:
 *        it will be able to receive and send broacast messages. On most systems this
 *        requires special user privileges.
 *        Returns the socket, and if an error occours, the socket error message
 *        and code are set.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetDGramBind( nPort, [cAddress [, bBroadcast] ] ) --> SOCKET
 *        Creates a datagram oriented socket and binds it to a particular port, and
 *        eventually to a certain interface if cAddress is given and not NIL.
 *        If bBroadcast is set to .T., the routine creates a broadcast capable socket:
 *        it will be able to receive and send broacast messages. On most systems this
 *        requires special user privileges.
 *        Returns the socket, and if an error occours, the socket error message
 *        and code are set.
 *      
 *      
 *      InetDGramSend( SOCKET, cAddress, nPort, cBuffer [, nSize ] ) --> NUMERIC
 *        Sends a datagram (a fixed lengt data) to a determined ip address (cAddress,
 *        to be specified in quad-dot notation) and port. If nSize is not specified,
 *        all the data in cBuffer will be sent; if nSize is specified, only
 *        the first nSize bytes of cBuffer will be sent.
 *        There isn't any guarantee that all the data required to be written is
 *        really sent to the socket: the calling program should check for the
 *        numeric return and send iteratively send the unsent data, up to complete
 *        the message.
 *        Anyway, the raw datagram is sent and received as once, and any data
 *        that less than the system datagram size will be sent and received
 *        as a single item.
 *        If the socket is created in broadcast mode, the cAddress element
 *        can be a broadcast address.
 *        Returns -1 on error, or the number of bytes actually sent on success.
 *      
 *      InetDGramRecv( SOCKET, cBuffer [, nSize ] ) --> NUMERIC
 *        Reads at maximum nSize bytes incoming from a UDP socket, if nSize is
 *        given, or reads at maximum cBuffer length if nSize is not given.
 *        There isn't any guarantee that all the data required to be read is
 *        really sent from the kernel to the application: the kernel should
 *        just return the last complete datagram that has been received, up
 *        to nSize bytes.
 *        Returns -1 on error, or the number of bytes actually read on success.
