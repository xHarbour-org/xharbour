FOREWORDS
=========

This document is meant to explain the internals of xHBThreads subsystem, and how
it intearacts with the pre-existing Virtual Machine.

First consideration that must be clear to the readers is that the xHBThreads
subsystem is meant to be a portable, multiplatform isomorphic system, that is
to say, at a PRG final program level, a system that "seem" to behave equally both
in windows and unix/posix systems.

Secondly, the explanation approach that will be undertaken here will be often
based upon signaling the differences among MS-Windows threading and posix threads,
used for unix systems.

Finally, it must be stated that this document explains the "basis" of the xHBThread
system, including also some example of firsts implementations in critical non-vm
elements, as the console output and the internet system. Work must be still done
to secure other parts of the libraries (like filesystem I/O, RDD, etc.).


Document conventions
--------------------

In this documents, areas of particular interest will be marked with the following
signs:

[TODO] This is an area where the author or the other developers have still... things
to do ;-). It is important to state those "to do" intentions to explain where the
developement is meant to lead.

[LEFTOVERS] This is an area explaining something that has been left in the code,
generally in form of commented areas or unused functions, both in lines of
developement now abandoned (but still not definitely "to be discarded"), or for
probable future developements. This areas might confuse casual readers, if not
warned about their leftover status.

[RFC] Requests for comments. While all comments are welcome, this text explicitly
requires help and support of other developers, that are thus invited to mail a
comment about it to the author.

[SUPP] Supposing here. Being Italian, and having never lived in an english speaking
country, I often tend to use improperly english language strucures, i.e. to state
doubts or suppositions. I.e. I discovered that while "might" is used in Italian to
state a "fleeble" supposition, just something like "what if...", is often used
by english speaking person just to politely state a sure thing. To avoid
misunderstandings, I will prepend this sign where I am just supposing. In such
cases I will also provide an explanation on why I have a certain "impression" 
about phenomena that I have obserbed.




BASIC RULES OF THE SYSTEM
=========================

xHBThreads is based upon some simple rules, that are to be enforced in all the
thread-aware or thread-sensible parts of the code. This rules are known to be
"tread-safe" by a long literature in this field, and a well eshtablished worldwide
practice.

1) Threads are unsafe unless guarded against concurrency. The direct consequence
of this rule in xHBThreads is that a mechanism has been setup to prevent threads
from being interrupted, suspended or inspected in their local data, unless they
declare that they are ready for such operations.

2) Thread safety is tightly bound with private data usage. A thread that is
declaring that it's internal data are inspectable is also declaring that its safe
to suspend it.

3) A thread can be canceled only at certain points, called "cancellation points".

4) A thread must arrive to any cancellation point with internal data being safe.

5) A thread holding mutexes of any kind must release them before engaging
any cancellation point, or must properly prepare them to be automatically unlocked
during cancelation.

6) Cross locking is strictly forbidden. A thread can't lock any mutex if it's already
owning another mutex EXCEPT if all these conditions are met:
6.1) If the inner lock does not cross any cancelation point, or if it is present a
cancellation pointm, if all the locks are prepared to be automatically released.
6.2) If the inner lock is released before the outer lock.
6.3) If there isn't any infinite wait inside the inner lock.
6.4) If the inner and outer lock are NEVER reversed in any part of the program.

7) The rule 6.4 means that mutexes must have a clean hierarcy of locking, which
means that there are some mutexes at lower level that must never be locked
before locking mutexes at higher level. Generally, the levels are:
7.1) global PRG level data access mutexes
7.2) local PRG level data access mutexes  / thread execution control mutexes
7.3) allocation mutexes


BASIC CONCEPTS IN IMPLEMENTATION
================================

To allow a simpler implementation of those rules, some macros have been defined.
Most of these macros have been declared as "void" to allow compilation of the
code both in MT mode and in ST mode, without the need to guard any section of
the MT specific with an #ifdef HB_THREAD_SUPPORT section. Same kind of strategy
have been adopted with regards to the different code needed for unix and windows,
where applicable.

A thread starts with its data being declared safe but with cancellation disabled.
After initialization, and after entering the first time. In fact, the data is
created outside the scope of inspectors, and added to their scope only after being
safely created and filled with initialization data. Newborn threads won't change
this fact until first entering the VM loop. At this moment, the macro HB_STACK_LOCK
is called: this atomically declares that the stack is not available anymore for
external inspection, because the owner thread is going to mangle with it.

Here the thread is still cancelation safe, and other than this, it is granted that
the internal data of the thread, or the stack, cannot be changed by any external
event, and cannot be read while the thread is still delivering important changes.

Before any point that can cause a long wait, or an infinite one, or in calculation
intensive locations (not involving the stack), the macro HB_STACK_UNLOCK is called
to signal other threads that the stack is in a consistent state, and that it won't be
used for a certain time.

Also, the stack is unlocked anyway whe the VM has done a certain amount of cylces;
[RFC] currenty this count is fixed to 20 (by the HB_HB_VM_UNLOCK_PERIOD macro in 
thread.h).

When the thread needs back its stack, it will call HB_STACK_UNLOCK. Please, note that
there are some mechanisms (different in windows and unix) to ensure that the thread
is not able to lock it's stack if it's currently being inspected; we'll se them in
a while.

Also, it is necessary to be sure that the stack of a thread is consistent before to
cancel it; so a thread must be sure to leave its stack in a clean status (unlocking
it) before entering any cancelation point. However, the inverse is not true:
having the stack unlocked is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a thread
to be canceled.

Finally, notice that the concept of stack locking does not involves any mutex. The
thread having its stack locked is not holding a specific mutex if not in the moments
that the lock/unlock are made. This is very important with regards of the rule number 6.



Inspectors, Stacks and active Thread count
------------------------------------------

Those threads that are somehow interested in the status of another thread, or of
all the other threads, are called inspectors. The latter are specifically called "idle
inspectors", since they can operate correctly only when NO OTHER THREAD IS CURRENTLY
HOLDING ANY LOCAL STACK. One of this idle inspector is the garbage collector.

[TODO] Add idle functions hook to allow PRG level programs to declare one or more
MT idle callbacks.

Threads can access their own stack using a thread-specific memory area. This is called
"thread key" in posix, and "Thread local storage" in windows; accessing this private
area does not requires locks on any mutex by the propretary thread. This fact is very
important, because if it weren't so, there would have been continuos breaking of rule
6. I.e. a funcion might have required a lock on some mutex, and then called another
function that had to access to the thread VM stack.

Other threads willing to get a thread private HB_VM_STACK must access a linked list
called "hb_ht_stack". The access of this list is locked, since it could be modified
in any moment by functions that are creating a new thread or removing an old one. So,
inspectors and "hb_ht_stack" management functions must achieve the lock on a mutex
called hb_threadStackMutex. This is done by the function hb_threadGetStack( id ),
where the ID is the ThreadID of the thread holding the stack that the caller is
interested in.

Idle inspectors have the need to access all the thread local stacks at once. Also,
they could need not having other threads being concurrently running with them for
other reason, i.e. critical access. Finally even a non inspector thread could be
willing to know how many threads are running concurrently in that moment, i.e. for
debugging reasons, or to prevent cpu over-usage. A new form of thread aware object
has been introduced to manage this need, and also other needs that could be met in
future. It is called "Shared Resource".

Shared resources are objects guarded by a mutex and being capable to signal a status 
change to the interested listeners. The structure is defined as follows:

typedef struct tag_HB_SHARED_RESOURCE
{
   HB_CRITICAL_T Mutex;  // mutex is used to read or write safely
   union {              // data that can be read or written
      volatile long asLong;
      volatile void *asPointer;
   } content;
   volatile unsigned int aux;
   HB_COND_T Cond; //condition that may change
} HB_SHARED_RESOURCE;


The content can be a "long int" or a void pointer, being able to hold i.e. a count
or any kind of strucutre. There is also an AUX integer, that could be used for
any auxiliary or ancillary role, as a count for a small fixed-lenght vector held
in the pointer.

[LEFTOVER] There are various macros meant to manage shared resources, but they are
meant for future developement. At the moment, the only use for the shared resource
is to hold the count of the currently running threads, or the status of the idle
inspector queue under windows.

The shared resource used to count the running threads is called hb_runningStacks.




INSIDE POSIX THREAD IMPLEMENTATION
==================================

Posix threading systems has some peculiarities that must be noted:
- Cancellation is issued by the canceling thread to the canceled one, the second
  one will receive the cancelation in a random moment that could possibly be
  AFTER the thread is rescheduled and then excecuted.
- Cancelation requests can be completely ignored, honored as soon as they arrive
  (asynchronous cancelation) or at at cancelation points.
- Some cancelation points can be controlled by the thread, like time waiting functions,
  condition wait functions, and explicit test_cancel() functions.
- Other cancelation points cannot be controled, like OS I/O (read, write, etc.)
- Linux implementation of pthreads is -sayed- not to respect the uncontrollable
  cancelation points (OS I/O); a workaround is suggested (and here applied, see
  below).
- Condition signaling is implemented by rescheduling one thread that is currently
  waiting for a condition, and making it "runnable" again. It is also possible to
  reschedule all the waiting threads. Indeed, it is not possible to have late 
  subscriptions; the only thread that can be signaled are the ones that are already
  waiting for the condition to be signaled.
  
This points must be notede, because they radically differ from the windows thread
implementations. Constructs easily buildable in pthreads are impolssible to be directly
replicated in windows threads, and vice-versa.


The shared resource wait/signaling.
-----------------------------------

Directly from man page of pthread_cond_wait:
       
       A  condition  (short  for  ``condition variable'') is a synchronization
       device that allows threads to suspend execution and relinquish the pro-
       cessors  until  some  predicate  on shared data is satisfied. The basic
       operations on conditions are: signal the condition (when the  predicate
       becomes true), and wait for the condition, suspending the thread execu-
       tion until another thread signals the condition.

       A condition variable must always be associated with a mutex,  to  avoid
       the race condition where a thread prepares to wait on a condition vari-
       able and another thread signals the condition  just  before  the  first
       thread actually waits on it.

         .....
         .....

       Waiting until x is greater than y is performed as follows:

              pthread_mutex_lock(&mut);
              while (x <= y) {
                      pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mut);
              }
              /* operate on x and y */
              pthread_mutex_unlock(&mut);

       Modifications on x and y that may cause x  to  become  greater  than  y
       should signal the condition if needed:
              pthread_mutex_lock(&mut);
              /* modify x and y */
              if (x > y) pthread_cond_broadcast(&cond);
              pthread_mutex_unlock(&mut);


This is the only way to safely change a shared data among threads (variable x and y
in the example) and test for a value to have reached a precise level. 

The thing goes as follows: 1) the mutex is locked, and the thread willing to know if
a predicate is true before to proceed can safely test for it. 2) If the predicate is 
false, the thread put itself in wait for a better time; 3) pthread_cond_wait atomically
releases the mutex (so other threads can operate on the variables guarded by
the mutex) and puts the thread in wait. 4) Then, another thread can lock the variable(s),
mangle them and notify all interested threads with pthread_cond_broadcast. 
5) The threads will be waken up, and loop on the while. Note that on exit 
pthread_cond_wait will achieve back the mutex before to proceed.
If this this time the predicate evalutes to true (that is to say, if the condition
we were waiting for is really happened), the it is possibile to 6) operate on
the variable(s) in a protected, mutexed environment and then 7) release the mutex.

Also, since pthread_cond_wait is a cancelation point, the caller must 1) be sure that
cancelation is never issued before waiting or while waiting or 2) forbid cancelation. 

The mutex released by pthread_cond_wait is safe (cancellation is honored AFTER
releasing it), but any other cleanup action like i.e. freeing other shell-locked
mutexes, or freeing the thread specific stack, must be "pushed" with the 
pthread_cleanup_push() function. Those functions will be called before thread
is terminated: thread stack cleaning is implemented this way under pthread.

The implementation for the stack locking mechanism is as follows:

   #define HB_STACK_LOCK \
   {\
      HB_CRITICAL_LOCK( hb_runningStacks.Mutex );\
      if( ! HB_VM_STACK.bInUse ) \
      {\
         while ( hb_runningStacks.aux ) \
         {\
            HB_COND_WAIT( hb_runningStacks.Cond, hb_runningStacks.Mutex );\
         }\
         hb_runningStacks.content.asLong++;\
         HB_VM_STACK.bInUse = TRUE;\
         HB_COND_SIGNAL( hb_runningStacks.Cond );\
      }\
      HB_CRITICAL_UNLOCK( hb_runningStacks.Mutex );\
   }
      
Locking the stack is done by setting HB_VM_STACK.bInUse to TRUE. Also, this code slice
rises the number of runningStacks; both theese operations are guarded by the mutex
associated with hb_runningStacks. The wait condition ( on hb_runningStacks.aux ) is called
"idle fence" and is explained below.

Unlocking is done by:

   #define HB_STACK_UNLOCK \
   {\
      HB_CRITICAL_LOCK( hb_runningStacks.Mutex );\
      if( HB_VM_STACK.bInUse ) \
      {\
         hb_runningStacks.content.asLong--;\
         HB_VM_STACK.bInUse = FALSE;\
         HB_COND_SIGNAL( hb_runningStacks.Cond );\
      }\
      HB_CRITICAL_UNLOCK( hb_runningStacks.Mutex );\
   } 

As can be noticed, the status change in the stack usage is done only if the stack
is in the opposite state. Stack lock and unlock are non-recursive operations. This
ensures that the calling program is always in control of what status is a stack in:
after a stack lock, the stack will be locked, and after an unlock it will be unlocked.


The Idle Fence
--------------

The idle fence is a systems that:

1) Is risen just before an idle routine enters in control, or soon after it.
2) Forbids the threads to lock their stack, making them to wait for the
   fence to be lowered.
   
The fence allows an idle routine to be sure that no other thread will be able to
access the stack in an exclusive way, blocking all other threads from proceding
after the STACK_LOCK step. 

An idle routine can rise the fence before waiting for the fact of being the only
thread left running. This makes all the other non-idle threads to block after
having released their stacks, and just before being able to reacquire it.
In this way, the idle routine will take control as soon as possible, or as soon as
all the other threads have unlocked their stacks.

It is possible also not to rise the fence when the idle routine is invoked. In this
case, the routine will wait for all the treads to be idle; this can happen pretty
rarely in a normal situation, but it can often happen when all the treads (or a
great part of them) are sure to engage long waits, like i.e. user input or internet
connections. In those situations, it is better to wait for all the thread to be really
idle and then proceed with the idle inspector; this will save CPU time as the inspector
will be activated only when there is really nothing to do for a certain time.

Any way, the fence MUST be risen before the idle routine begins to mangle with other
threads internal stacks, to avoid the risk of concurrent access to the data.

A variable called hb_bIdleFence is provided for this reason. If it's true (default),
the idle fence will be rise as soon as an idle routine is invoked. This variable
can be safely read or set while holding the hb_runninStacks mutex.


Cleanup Procedure
-----------------

A cleanup procedure is automatically called at thread termination, both if the thread
is canceled in a cancelation point or if the thread regularily terminates.
The procedure take cares of:

1) Freeing all PRG level mutexes. PRG mutexes are held in a linked list, and a cancelation
   will cause them to be freed "safely" before the thread terminates.
2) Locking the stack, cleaning it and removing it from the stack structure.

It is necessary to make sure that no thread is holding a system level mutex at cancelation
points, or that those mutexes are freed automatically using the cleanup push functions.

[LEFTOVER] Three macros are provided for that: HB_CLEANUP_PUSH, HB_CLEANUP_POP and
HB_CLEANUP_POP_EXEC. Currently, I didn't feel the need of using them except for
thread termination and console.c (where they are encapsulated in another macro),
so it is also possible that a direct pthrea_cleanup* family call could be used.

[LEFTOVER] A couple of functions (hb_threadRawMutexUnlock and hb_threadMutexUnlock) are
provided specifically to be used as cleanup functions, unlocking raw OS mutexes or PRG
mutexes respectively. Currently, the latter is never used.


Data sets
---------

The relationship between group of variables and mutexes guarding them are called "data sets".
In the POSIX implementation, they are currently the following:

- hb_runningStacks.mutex: other than the idle fence (aux field) and active stacks count 
  (content.asLong), this variable guards the bInUse field of the thread-aware VM stack, 
  that states if a stack is currently used by the owning thread or not.

- hb_threadStackMutex: this mutex regulates access to the linked list holding all the
  stacks (hb_ht_stack).
  
- hb_mutexMutex: this mutex regulates access to the list of PRG level mutexes, that must
  be scanned at thread termination for unclean mutexes. 
  
- hb_garbageAllocMutex: used to have single thread access to the pool of recycled data
  or to the garbage collection facilities that are provided by the GC.
  
- hb_allocMutex: used to provide single thread access to the memory statisctics in fm.c,
  and also to exclude concurrent access to malloc() and free(), that are thread unsafe
  on most systems.
  



  

INSIDE WINDOWS THREAD IMPLEMENTATION
====================================

We'll treat windows threading by difference with respect of the POSIX model. Main 
differences that are to be noted are the followings:

- Cancellation can only be done by a canceling thready by removing a target thread from
  the execution queue, thus preventing the target thread from ever being rescheduled, and
  stopping it immediately if running in a mutliprocessor environment.
  In other words, we have true realtime cancelations, that leave even the OS stack unclean.
- There isn't a OS specific mechanism to screen from cancelation, (except a "rights" 
  management that is not applicable for our needs).  
- Condition signaling is implemented by "rising" a variable status, and "automatically"
  resetting it when a thread receives the notification. Also, manual reset is available
  (the status stays UP until explicitly lowered). In other words, late subscription is
  both available and enforced.
  [RFC] I haven't tried it out, considering that a little heavy and willing to implement
  a more windows-oriented mechanism, but probably a ResetEvent( var ), followed by a
  WaitForSingleObject( var ) can simulate the pthread signaling scheme.
- There isn't any "condition broadcasting" mechanism. The only way to emulate it is to
  have a condition be manually reset after the last waiting thread has been resumed, and
  being sure not to put in wait any thread in the meanwhile, but this is a tricky thing 
  to do.
  

Kind Cancelation
----------------

A deferred cancelation scheme (like the one used in posix) can be easily implemented in
windows by having a variable stating if a thread has been requested to be canceled. This
variable can be periodically checked, and if it is set, the thread calls it's cleanup
routine(s) and quits by its own initiative.

[RFC] Anyway, there is no way to cleanly wake up an infinite wait function, like a cond
wait or a file I/O read, and then test for cancelation. The only thing that can interrupt
such a function is an explicit TerminateThread issued from another thread. 

To allow a killer thread to know if a target is currently engaged in a possibly infinite
waiting function, a variable called bCanCancel is provided in the local stack of every
thread. A thread will set it whenever it thinks that an asyncrhonous, not kind cancelation
can be issue without (too much) danger. In this case, the killer will have to call the
cleanup functions for the killed thread.

PRG level mutexes are now implemented with windows Semaphores because this kind of object
are the only one that can be locked and unlocked by different threads, so the killer is
able to unlock the PRG mutexes locked by the killed.

[RFC] The problem is that neither the internal OS function are 100% thread safe. I.e., 
a function engaged in an endless wait, like a fread(), could have some memory allocated
BEFORE the lower OS layer wait, and even if the HB VM is completely "clean" at the moment,
there could be an OS generated memory leak (this notice is from MSDN documentation).

[LEFTOVER] A working cleanup pushing/popping mechanism were used before, but I have managed
doing all without the need of it, i.e. by having only one cleanup functions that is able to
clean memory and unlock PRG mutexes. Any way, the macros and windows specific push/pop
functions are still there in the case we need them back before completing the porting.

For the above reason (OS might leave memory leaks), I have differentiated the StopThread and
the KillThread PRG functions. The first issues a kind cancelation, while the second issues
a kind cancelation normally, and terminates the thread if the bCanCancel member of the
target stack is set. The latter function should be used 1) if the programmer knows that
the function used by the OS layer are threadsafe or 2) in programs or moments where small
memory leacks are forgivable, i.e. in small client programs that are going to run for a small
time or while the program is terminating.



Kind Cancelation implementation
-------------------------------

Three macros have been added to make easier access to the kind cancelation facilities:

#define HB_ENABLE_ASYN_CANC       HB_THREAD_GUARD( hb_cancelMutex, HB_VM_STACK.bCanCancel = TRUE )
#define HB_DISABLE_ASYN_CANC      HB_THREAD_GUARD( hb_cancelMutex, HB_VM_STACK.bCanCancel = FALSE ) 

#define HB_TEST_CANCEL_ENABLE_ASYN\
   {\
      HB_CRITICAL_LOCK( hb_cancelMutex );\
      if ( HB_VM_STACK.bCanceled )\
      {\
         HB_CRITICAL_UNLOCK( hb_cancelMutex );\
         hb_threadCancelInternal();\
      }\
      HB_VM_STACK.bCanCancel = TRUE;\
      HB_CRITICAL_UNLOCK( hb_cancelMutex );\
   }


First two macros are just a code to change the bCanCancel value, guarding that change with
a mutex (that is also locked by the killer threads). The latter macro is used for both
checking if the thread has been requested kindly to terminate, and then state that from
that point on the thread can be terminated asincrhonously. This macros are intended to
be used this way:

HB_TEST_CANCEL_ENABLE_ASYN;
WaitingForALongTimeInWindowsOS( .. );
HB_DISABLE_ASYN_CANC;

[LEFTOVER] HB_ENABLE_ASYN_CANC should not be used ( always use HB_TEST_CANCEL_ENABLE_ASYN), 
while  [TODO] HB_TEST_CANCEL has never been used, but should be used whenever there is a
pthread cancelation point, like i.e. thead sleeps.



Idle inspectors implementation
------------------------------

The joint effects of the different condition signaling scheme and of the more rigid mutex 
locking scheme (in windows is possible to kill a thread that is waiting for a mutex, while
this is forbidden in posix), forced to adopt a different implementation for stack locking
and idle functions. Also, this implementation results to be more efficient in windows, using
the native objects schemes:

   #define HB_STACK_LOCK \
   {\
      HB_CRITICAL_LOCK( hb_runningStacks.Mutex );\
      if( ! HB_VM_STACK.bInUse ) \
      {\
         hb_runningStacks.content.asLong++;\
         HB_VM_STACK.bInUse = TRUE;\
      }\
      HB_CRITICAL_UNLOCK( hb_runningStacks.Mutex );\
   }

   #define HB_STACK_UNLOCK \
   {\
      HB_CRITICAL_LOCK( hb_runningStacks.Mutex );\
      if( HB_VM_STACK.bInUse ) \
      {\
         HB_VM_STACK.bInUse = FALSE;\
         if ( --hb_runningStacks.content.asLong == 0)\
         {\
            hb_threadCallIdle();\
         }\
      }\
      HB_CRITICAL_UNLOCK( hb_runningStacks.Mutex );\
   }

As it can bee seen, nothing is signaled when the runningStacks content is changed,
but when the count reaches 0, the idle rouitines are called. A procedure called
hb_threadSubscribeIdle() is given to be used by procedures willing to be called
when there is no other thread running.

Notice that the idle call is made during stack unlock of the last therad currently
running (currently having stack in use), and being the mutex locked, this forbids
other thrads from regaining the lock on the stack.

[SUPP] This scheme is fairly unsafe under posix, as posix mutexes are tought as
"small, critical section guards". POSIX mutex should not cross function calls.

Idle functions are enqueued by hb_threadSubscribeIdle and then called in turn
all at once.

[TODO] Currently, there is no fence guard in windows implementation. It seems
that this fact is not particularily heavy, as the locking schemes are often
causing  hb_runningStacks.content.asLong to be 0; also, under posix this 
condition is necessary, but not sufficient to start the Idle inspectors, 
while under windows the idle inspectors are called as soon as the stack
holding threads count reaches 0. Any way, having a fence guard is safer
in all the situations, and will be probably implemented also on windows.


Data sets
---------

Other than POSIX thraed data sets, window porting needs:

- hb_cancelMutex: to regulate kind cancelation requests; it locks bCanCancel and
  bCanceled field of the HB_VM_STACK.
  
- hb_idleQueueRes: to regulate access to the idle queue. It is a shared resource
  holding the linked list of queued idle functions.
  

  

WHAT IS HAPPENING IN HVM.C
==========================

Stack is unlocked, but cancellation is not allowed, up to hb_vmExecute() main loop 
start. Then the stack is locked, and eventually unlocked only
- if the VM is returning (exiting from hb_vmExecute() )
- if the VM has completed a number of loops equal to HB_VM_UNLOCK_PERIOD (currently 20)

Lock is reacquired at the intrance in a new VM execution, or soon after the periodic unlock.
iCount local variable is used to determine if the lock must be released and re-achieved.

Pelase, notice that locking an already locked stack has no effect, so if a hb_vmExecute() 
calls recursively itself (e.g. via an hb_vmDo() ), the stack is locked from before the call
to the next unlock.

If the VM calls another function (with hb_vmDo, hb_vmSend or hb_codeblockEval), then the 
called hb_vmExecute() will unlock the stack on exit. For this reason, those functions must
relock the stack as soon as the hb_vmExecute returns. Notice also that, since relocking a
stack has no effect, this does not cause any problem if hb_vmDo() functions and alike ones
are going to call a function that WON'T free the stack on exit.





WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CONSOLE.C
==============================

Console is an interesting example of threadsafing of older code, and some words about it must 
be told, also because some aspects of that implementaution have not been completely decided.

First of all, notice that all the output in console can be a cancelation point if directed 
to a device. So, the mutex that is used to coordinate output (hb_outputMutex) must be guarded
using a pthread cleanup function. Also, since a stream could easily be a network based file
or a standard stream, I/O can cause infinite waits, so it is fairly unwise to turn off
cancelation just to spare hb_outputMutex.

Under windows, it is almost sure that console output is going to be used to write to the screen,
and that it will never generate an infinite wait; for this reason, it seems pretty useless
to port cleanup functions. Also, for the same reason, asyncronous cancelation is never
allowed.





WHAT IS HAPPENING IN GARBAGE.C
==============================

Garbage collector (hb_gcCollectAll() ) is an idle inspector. For this reason, it must implement
Idle inspector semantics.
