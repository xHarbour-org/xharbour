 *      HB_SERVICE()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *      Service management & IPC
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      Service oriented program startup
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      HB_SERVICE( lDetach ) 
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <lDetach>
 *  $RETURNS$
 *
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      Starts a service oriented program.
 *
 *      This was formerly used to install a signal handler, so that HB_PUSHSIGNALHANDLER
 *      routine family may work from that point on. Now, signal handlers are 
 *      self-installed by those routines; currently, HB_SERVICE() does something
 *      only when lDetach is set to true.
 *
 *      When this happens, the current process is detached from the console, in
 *      a system specific way. Under UNIX, the process is forked and the parent
 *      is terminated, so that only the child is left alive; this grants the
 *      child to work independently by any lanucher that may have started it (be it
 *      a console, a shell or a X Window Manager). Threads, variables and previously
 *      existing signal handlers are preserved.
 *
 *      Under windows, the console (if present) is detached. By calling this function before
 *      any GT output, it's possible to effectively hide the program execution, so that
 *      it can be put in autoexec.bat, win.ini RUN= entry, or windows registry RUN 
 *      key(s) and run in the background.
 *
 *      In future, this function will also hook Win32 service support, where available.
