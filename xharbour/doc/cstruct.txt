------------------

Syntax:
-------

   Definition:
   -----------

   C STRUCTURE <strucName> [Align <align>]
     [ MEMBER <memberName> IS <CTYPEDEF> ]
     [ MEMBER <memberName[<arrayLength>]> IS <CTYPEDEF> ]
     [ MEMBER <memberName> IS <CTYPEDEF>(<arrayLength>) ]
     [ MEMBER <memberName> IS|INPLACE <strucName> ]
     [ MEMBER <memberName> AS <strucName> ]
     [ ... ]
   END C STRUCTURE

   Example:
   --------

     // Explicit Alignment.
     C STRUCTURE MyNestedStructure Align 1
       Member c1[2] IS CTYPE_CHAR
       Member l2    IS CTYPE_LONG
     END C STRUCTURE

     // Different Alignment.
     C STRUCTURE MyStructure Align 4
       Member sName    IS CTYPE_CHAR_PTR
       Member cAge     IS CTYPE_CHAR
       Member uiWeight IS CTYPE_UNSIGNED_INT
       Member dHeight  IS CTYPE_DOUBLE

       // This is IN-PLACE - Note IS clause (may also use INPLACE clause).
       Member Nested   IS MyNestedStructure

       // This is DETACHED - Note AS clause.
       Member pNext    AS MyStructure
     END C STRUCTURE


   Usage:
   ------

   <lValue> IS <strucName>

     Example:
     --------
       LOCAL oStructure IS MyStructure

Properties:
-----------

   acTypes        -> Array Of CTYPE Definitions of Structure Members.
   nAlign         -> [READ ONLY] Alignment attribute of the C Structure.
   SizeOf         -> [READ ONLY] The equivalent of C' sizeof( STRUCTURE ).
   nId            -> [READ ONLY] Unique ID of this Structure.
   InternalBuffer -> [READ ONLY] String representation of the C Structure memory image.

   [xMember] -> Each Structure Member is represented by a given Property of the same name.


Methods:
--------

   Reset              -> Initializes all Structure Member properties to NIL.

   Buffer( [New] )    -> Optionally SET the InternalBuffer to a new image, which will automatically
                         call the DeValue() Method to reflect the change in Member Properties.

                      -> Return a copy of the InternalBuffer.

   Value              -> Return a newly calculated C Structure Image and record it into InternalBuffer.

   DeValue            -> Calculates new values for all Member Properties to reflect the current image of
                         the C Structure from the InternalBuffer.

                         Return Array of Member Properties values.

   Array              -> Return Array of Member Properties values.

   SayMembers( cPad ) -> Outputs formated list of all Members and Sub-Members.

   Init( aValues )    -> Initializes the structure with the values supplied in the [optionaly nested]
                         aValues array.

                      -> Return refernce to the initialized stracture object.


   Pointer( [nNew] )  -> Optionally SET the InternalBuffer to a new image (pointed to by nNew), which will
                         automatically call the Buffer() Method (and thus DeValue()) to reflect the change
                         in Member Properties.

                      -> Return the Pointer address of the InternalBuffer.


PRG Support Functions:
----------------------

  __ActiveStructure( cStructure, nAlign )         -> PP Syntax Support. Registers the new Structure.

                                                     Return refernce to the Definitions Array of the Structure.

  HB_MemberDefinition( cMember, CType )           -> PP Syntax Support. Adds the Memebr Definition to the
                                                     Current Structure.

  HB_CStructureID( cStructure )                   -> Returns the ID of a given Structure by LITERAL Name.


  HB_CStructure( cStructure, nAlign )             -> Creates a new Instance of a C Structure Class for the
                                                     Active Structure. If such Structure was already defined
                                                     it will instanciate an object of the pre-existing class,
                                                     otherwise it will create new Class matching the definitions
                                                     and will instanciate the new class.

                                                     Return new object instance of the specified C Structure class.

  HB_CStructureFromID( nId, nAlign )              -> Creates a new Instance of a C Structure based on the Structure ID.

                                                     Return new object instance of the specified C Structure class.

  HB_SizeOfCStructure( acTypes, nAlign )          -> Return the equivalent of C' sizeof( STRUCTURE ) for the given specs.

  HB_ArrayToStructure( aValues, acTypes, nAlign ) -> Return a String representation of the C Structure memory image
                                                     for the given values in array aValues based on given definitions.

  HB_StructureToArray( Buffer, acTypes, nAlign )  -> Return an Array calculated from the given C Structure memory image
                                                     based on given definitions.

  HB_IS_CStructure( xVal )                        -> Return .T. if the passed value is a C Structure Class Object.



C Support Functions:
--------------------

  unsigned int SizeOfCStructure( PHB_ITEM aDef, unsigned int uiAlign )
  -> Return the calculated equivalent of C' sizeof( STRUCTURE ) for the given definitions.

  PHB_ITEM ArrayToStructure( PHB_ITEM aVar, PHB_ITEM aDef, unsigned int uiAlign )
  -> Return the equivalent of C Structure Memory Image for the given parameters.

  PHB_ITEM StructureToArray( BYTE *Buffer, PHB_ITEM aDef, unsigned int uiAlign )
  -> Return xHarbour C Structure Class Object for the given parameters.
