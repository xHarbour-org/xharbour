  + xharbour/sourc/rtl/gtwvt/wvtcore.c
    Contains all GUI primitive functions.

  + xharbour/sourc/rtl/gtwvt/wvtutils.c
    Contain all utility functions except GT related.

  * xharbour/sourc/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    Break the code in smaller logical chunks and distributed them in
    multiple files. This file now contains core GT functionality and 
    rest of functions are distributed in above files.
  
  * xharbour/include/hbgtwvt.h
    Some prototype rotation from static to extern.

  * xharbour/ makefile.bc
  * xharbour/ makefile.nt
  * xharbour/ makefile.wc
  * xharbour/ makefile.vc
    Added above files.

  /*
     The management of GTWVT was becoming more and more complex due to 
     everything being put in single file. Moreover, as I am about to add
     Wvt*Classes to make WVT OOP instead of function oriented, I felt the
     need to give it a proper code placement.

  * source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    + define _WIN32_IE if not defined. For MinGW and Open-Watcom

2004-05-11 23:33 UTC+0530 Pritpal Bedi <pritpal@vouchcac.com>
  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    + Wvt_DrawStatusbar()
      Draws Windows alike statusbar on the row ( defaults to maxrow() ) specified
      Panels.

    + static void hb_wvt_gtCreateToolTipWindow( void )
      Creates and places the hWndTT returned by above function in _s.hWndTT member.

    + Wvt_SetTooltipActive( lYesNo )
      Get/Set flag to show or prevent tooltip to be displayed.

    + Wvt_SetToolTip( nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight, cToolText )
      Sets a tooltip to be displayed when mouse hovers over specified screen coordinates.

  * xharbour/include/hbgtwvt.ch
    + HWND hWndTT;
    + BOOL bToolTipActive;
      Added members to GLOBAL_DATA _s to hold functionality of tooltips.

    /*
    Functions above are the building blocks of upcoming Wvt*Classes and must not
    be used as per.

    The working classes which can be enhanced greatly per now are:

    WvtDialog():New( nRows, nCols, cBarTitle, cFont, nFontHeight, nFontWidth, nFontWeight )
       This adjusts the current window to above parameters and is the parent to all classes below.

    WvtBrowse():New( oParent, nID, nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight )
    WvtStatusBar():New( oParent, nID, nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight )
    WvtPanel():New( oParent, nID, nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight )

    Now the point is where this class library be put on CVS?

    My proposal is it should be part of existing gtwvt.lib and be placed
    in source/rtl/gtwvt alongwith gtwvt.c. But more knowledgable comments are welcome.

    Please note that these classes are enhancement over and above the normal
    behavior of GTWVT and in no way interrupt its functioning. Instead, developer is
    free to use the classes per requirements.

    ! fixed some warnings reported by Lorenzo. Please check it since
      I cannot test it on Linux.

2004-05-07 17:30 UTC+0200 Lorenzo Fiorini <lorenzo_fiorini/at/tin.it>

    + #define WVT_FONTS_MAX  20
    + #define WVT_PENS_MAX   20
    + HFONT hUserFonts[ WVT_FONTS_MAX ]
    + HPEN  hUserPens[ WVT_PENS_MAX ]
      Array to hold user defined fonts and pens. The objects thus held are
      released automatically when application terminates.

  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    * Wvt_LoadPicture( nSlot, cImageFile )
      Reversed the parameter order for generic compatibality with other such functionality.

    * hb_wvt_gtDrawImage()
    * hb_wvt_gtRenderPicture()
      A big bug fixed which was causing Resource leak which was crashing the  application
      on OS which had low resource profiles such as Win9x family.

    + Wvt_LoadFont( nSlot, cFontFace, nHeight, nWidth, nWeight, lItalic, ;
                    lUnderline, lStrikeout,nCharSet, nQuality, nEscapement )
      Creates the font with requested attributes and stores the handle
      in _s.hUserFont[ iSlot ( nSlot - 1 ) ]

    + Wvt_LoadPen( nSlot, nStyle, nThick, nRGBColor )
      As above.

    + Wvt_DrawLabelEx(  nRow, nCol, cLabel, nAlign, nTextColor, nBkColor, nSlot )
      Just like Wvt_DrawLabel() but with reduced parameters substituting <nSlot>
      for all parameters related with font used. This way the need to recreate
      the same font over and over is eliminated.

    + Wvt_DrawLineEx( nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight, nOrient, nFormat, nAlign, nSlotPen )
      Similar to Wvt_DrawLine() but substituting pen parameter with <nSlotPen>.

    + Wvt_DrawOutlineEx( nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight, nSlotPen )
      Similar to Wvt_DrawOutline() but substituting pen parameter with <nSlotPen>.

  * xharbour/tests/wvtgui.prg
    Updated to demonstrate the mechanism achieved with above functions.

  /*
     It is a common practice with every application to have common pens and fonts
     for a variety of purposes. So, to speedup the refresh time, AND, more importantly,
     to prevent GDI resources to be exhausted ( Win9x systems ), this mechanism has
     facilitated superbly. Hope you all will find it useful.

     With the above update I have achieved the complete stability of my applications
     on all versions on Windows.

  * xharbour/include/hbgtwvt.h
    + #define WVT_PICTURES_MAX  20
    + IPicture _s.iPicture[ WVT_PICTURES_MAX ]
      Array to hold image stream loaded by hb_wvt_gtLoadPicture().

  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    + hb_wvt_gtLoadPicture()
    + hb_wvt_gtRenderPicture()
    + Wvt_LoadPicture( cImageFile, nSlot )
    + Wvt_DrawPicture( nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight, aAdjPixels )
      hb_wvt_gtDrawImage() code is broken in two section, 1) to load image,
      and 2) render image. The image thus loaded is retained in _s.iPicture[ iSlot ]
      array slot and rendered when required.

    * Wvt_DrawImage()
    * Wvt_DrawButton()
      Now both these functions accept <cImage/nImageSlot> as its respective parameter.

  * xharbour/tests/wvtgui.prg
    Updated to demonstrate the mechanism achieved with above functions.

  /*

  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    + Wvt_CreatePopupMenu()
      Returns handle to the newly created popup menu. The menu thus created can be populated
      with prompts and submenus through Wvt_AppendMenu().

    + Wvt_SetPopupMenu()
      Returns or sets the context menu available through K_RBUTTONDN (See Below). In no menu
      handle is passed, NULL is assigned to _s.hPopup.

    * hb_wvt_gtMouseEvent()
      case WM_RBUTTONUP:
        if ( _s.hPopup )
        {
           GetCursorPos( &xy );
           lPopupRet = TrackPopupMenu( _s.hPopup, TPM_CENTERALIGN + TPM_RETURNCMD, xy.x, xy.y, 0, hWnd, NULL );
           if ( lPopupRet )
           {
              hb_wvt_gtAddCharToInputQueue( lPopupRet );
           }
          return;
        }
        else
        {
          keyCode = K_RBUTTONUP;
          break;
        }

      Adjusted to invoke the popup menu set through Wvt_SetPopupMenu(), and if found NULL, the event
      is passed to the user to process. The LONG value returned by TrackPopupMenu() which is the third
      parameter passed with Wvt_AppendMenu(), when a prompted is clicked, is posted to keyboard buffer
      which can be retrieved with Inkey() function.

  * xharbour/include/hbgtwvt.h
    + HMENU _s.hPopup member to the GLOBAL_DATA _s to hold the last menu assigned though Wvt_SetPopupMenu().

  * xharbour/tests/wvtgui.prg
    Updated to demonstrate the usage of Context menu with each screen available in the application.
    Just right-click anywhere on the screen and select an option.

  + include/wvtwin.ch
    To hold the Gtwvt specific constants:
    1) Constants to define Button Formats - Wvt_DrawButton().
    2) Constants to define Line Formats - Wvt_DrawLine()
    3) Menu Manipulation Constants. ( WinUser.h - Decimal Notation )
    4) Mouse Pointer Shape constants. ( WinUser.h - Changed to Ordinal Position )

  * The Usage:

    #include "wvtwin.ch"
    //-----------------------//
    Function Main()
    local hPopup := Wvt_SetPopupMenu() // Clears the slot and returns back any previous assigned menu.
    local hMenu, nKey

    hMenu := DefinePopup()
    Wvt_SetPopupMenu( hMenu )

    // During the execution of this code K_RBUTTONUP will invoke the Popup and will post the keycode
    // assigened to the menu prompt.

    nKey := inkey( 0, INKEY_ALL )
    if nKey == 299301
       // Do Something
    endif

    Wvt_SetPopupMenu( hPopup )         // Restores the previous menu handle
    Return nil

    //-----------------------//

    Static Function DefinePopup()
    Local hMenu, hMenu1

    hMenu := Wvt_CreatePopupMenu()
    Wvt_AppendMenu( hMenu, MF_ENABLED + MF_PROMPT, 299301, 'Do Something' )

    return hMenu

    //-----------------------//

    /*
    This way we can simulate any inkey code we desire and can act according to that.
    */

  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    * Formatting for recent changes.

    + Wvt_setPointer( nPointer )
      Set the mouse pointer shape to predefined mouse pointer which are in the
      range of 1-15. 1-12 are usable on all win versions whereas 13-15 are for
      winver > 4. To know what 1-15 constants means, please examine the gtwvt.c,
      at per now I have not found a suitable .ch file to place them ( someone to
      point ? ).

      Also please note that if you set pointer through it, all windows running as
      WVT windows will have the same pointer shape within them. So use it with care.

2004-03-31 11:10 UTC+0530 Pritpal Bedi <pritpal@vouchcac.com>
  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    * Wvt_Paint() now receives no parameters. nTop,nLeft,nBottom,nRight are shifted to
      _s.rowStart, _s.rowStop, _s.colStart, _s.colStop. The necessary changes are
      made to hb_wvt_gtWndProc() function.
    + Wvt_GetPaintRect() -> { nTop,nLeft,nBottom,nRight }
      It can be called if the rectangle to repaint needs to be known in Wvt_Paint().

      This enhancement has decreased the window refreshtime marginally.

2004-03-10 16:15 UTC+0530 Pritpal Bedi <pritpal@vouchcac.com>
  * xharbour/source/rtl/gtwvt/gtwvt.c
    * Wvt_Paint() at .prg level now received <nTop>, <nLeft>, <nBottom>, <nRight> coordinates of the screen
      being repainted instead of <hWindowHandle>. This seems to be more logical as it is now easier
      in the hands of the programmer to know whoch graphic objects need be painted again.

    + Wvt_Minimize()
      Minimizes the application window. Useful when application is engaged in 
      long uninterrupted tasks.

    + Wvt_Maximize()
      Maximizes, I mean, restores to normal position the previously minimized
      application window.
     
    + Wvt_SetOnTop()
      Forces the application window to be as the TOPMOST window. Useful when a 
      compulsory input is required, or, where developer wants that no other window
      is allowed to operlap application window.

    + Wvt_SetAsNormal()
      Restores windows TOPMOST attributes to normal. It is default, maens, any other
      window on the Desktop can be brought in focus overlapping application window.

    + Wvt_SaveScreen( nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight )
      Saves the designated rectangle in an array with three elelments, viz., 
      { nWidth, nHeight, hBitmap }. The bitmap image of the rectanle is retained
      in memory until Wvt_RestScreen() is called. So it is important that 
      Wvt_RestScreen() must be called when current program returns.

    + Wvt_RestScreen( nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight, aSavedScreen )
      Flushes the bitmap referenced in <aSavedScreen> onto the designated rectangle.
      This function must be called after Wvt_SaveScreen() just not to exhaust 
      GDI resources of Windows.

    ! Wvt_DrawLine( nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight, nOrientation, nFormat, nAlign, ;

      Line drawing has been made more user friendly.

    ! Formatting and logocal ordering of functions.

  * xharbour/tests/wvtgui.prg
    Enhanced to demonstrate above functions. A beautiful ststus bar is added. And much more.

    Now we can use clipboard!

    assign
    SetKey( K_CTRL_C, {|| WVT_CopyToClipboard() } )
    SetKey( K_CTRL_V, {|| WVT_PasteFromClipboard() } )

    then a simple idea, when copy to clipboard I copy the entire
    oGet:buffer, instead when paste I send the clipboard to
    keyboard buffer but only if there is an active Get
    This permit to me to don't think to selection at the moment.

        whenever a WM_PAINT message is received by the window.

        I propose that WVT_PAINT, or something lik that, function be part of standard GT
        which should in turn executes all code blocks put on a stack by the user. The
        primary job of those code blocks will be to call GUI functions with appropriate
        parameter.

        This concept has been shown in tests/wvtgui.prg. This window console offers
        immense possibilities to be explored and incorporated and hope that
