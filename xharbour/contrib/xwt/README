ABSTRACT
========

XWT (extended windowing toolkit) is an abstract, portable, multiplatform
windowing toolkit.

XWT is mainly a layer on which widget libraries lies to provide a standardized
and common GUI programming interface for xHarbour programs. The abstract layer
is designed to match the following criteria:

1) Portable: the abstract level of the windowing api ensures a common
programming interface under very different graphic rendering subsystems, as
XWindows, MacOSX, OS2 and Windows. Also, the interface for that subsystem
can be implemented using middle level widgets or windowing APIs, like i.e.
QT, wxWindows or GTK.

2) Easy to use: the API is meant to be easily used-by-hand, without any other
instrument like i.e. graphical GUI designers. Of course, logical GUI
definitions (like XML definitions or designer produced widget set) can also
be used, but API is still programmer-friendly.

3) Object orientation: XWT API is basically object oriented, as all the modern
windowing api.

4) Event driven: xHarbour programs will receive events from every meaningful
GUI state change, i.e. menu selection or command button pressure. Callbacks
to handle the events can be dynamically configured at runtime, adding or
removing event listeners on the fly; even listeners can be standard XBASE
functions or methods bound to specific classes or objects.

5) Easy driver programming: the programming interface toward the lower system
driver (be it a middle level interface to widget APIs, or a lower level
windowing subsystem programming) has a very small interface, which is
built upon a restricted set of interface functions. This functions can be
incrementally written, and features still not implemented can be safely
ignored. So, it is possible to have workable drivers also if they are still
under developement.




STATUS
======

Currently, XWT is under heavy developement, and many features are subject to
swift and radical changes.



BASIC CONCEPTS
==============

XWT API is organized into three layers:

- PRG interface is the class and function set available to the final xHarbour
program.

- INTERNAL interface is a C implementation that carries the messages between
the PRG interface and the lower DRIVER level.

- DRIVER interface is a set of function that each driver must implement, and
has the role to present the XWT commands and objects to the lower system API;
the lower system api can be both a system level API (as the Windows WINAPI or
the XWindows XLIB) or a widget API (as GTK, QT, xyWindows or whatever else).

XWT is built around the concept of "flexible" widgets. Each element of the PRG
API is considered a subclass of XwtWidget, excluding a few elemets as the
Message Box.
XwtWidget itself is an abstract class, that should never be instantiated by
the final program, but that can be used by programs to develop new widgets.

The PRG interface dialogs with the DRIVER with a limited set of functions,
divided into generic and specific ones. Generic functions are XWT_Init(),
XWT_Quit() and XWT_Main() functions. They are translated by the INTERNAL
interface into xwt_drv_init(), xwt_drv_quit() and xwt_drw_main(). We'll
discuss them later.

DRIVER level widgets representation are created and managed with widget
specific functions. There are three kind of "logical" objects that are
shared among the XWT PRG and DRIVER levels:

- Widget types: they are a standardized set of logical widget types
(possibly expanded by the final PRG application) that are known by
the PRG and DRIVER levels, and are defined as numeric IDs. They are
found in "xwt.ch", and are named as XWT_TYPE_*

- Event types: they are represent as numeric IDs. There is also an
"event" object in the XWT PRG layer, but we'll discuss it later.

- Property types: again, they are represented as numeric ID defined in
xwt.ch

* NOTICE: Since all this global definitions are in xwt.ch, this file must be
  includedby both the PRG applications willing to use XWT and the DRIVER
  levelimplementation programs.



INTERNAL DRIVER LEVEL API
=========================


  Raw widgets and creation
  ------------------------

Each XwtWidget incorporates a member called oRawWidget, holding a pointer to
a DRIVER specific object. It is responsibility of the driver to define
structures or objects useful to hold the state of the underlying system
level API. This "raw widget" is created by the driver, reimplementing the
following function defined in xwt_api.h

PXWT_WIDGET xwt_drv_create( PHB_ITEM pSelf, int xwt_type );

PXWT_WIDGET is a pointer to the raw widget structure, while pSelf is a
PHB_ITEM pointing to the object that requested the creation of the raw widget,
while the xwt_type is one of the types defined in xwt.ch, or an application
defined type. The driver must here switch() on the xwt_type and create a
metastructure that can be later used to reference the widget; if the widget
type is not recognized or still not implemented, the routine can return NULL.

The widget structure is defined as follows:

typedef struct tag_xwt_widget
{
   // type is at disposal of drivers to interpret widget data correctly
   int type;

   void (*destructor)(void *data);
   void *(*get_main_widget)( void *data );
   void *(*get_top_widget)( void *data );

   // pointer to raw widget data that is known by virtual functions
   void *widget_data;
} XWT_WIDGET, *PXWT_WIDGET;

All the elements of XWT_WIDGET are managed by the DRIVER level functions,
and are at disposal of the driver implementation. We'll discuss this structure
afterwards.

* NOTICE: the PRG level function XWT_create( oSelf, nInt ) --> pointer acts as
  a bridge between the xHarbour code and the lowere level driver. XWT classes
  calls this function to create the lower level widget, and this function
  calls the xwt_drv_create() after cleaning up the parameters.


  Example of widget creation
  --------------------------

At prg level, a New() method for a non-abstract widget should be instantiated
as follows:

METHOD New( cId, nPosX, nPosY ) class MyNiceWidget
   ::Super:New()

   ::oRawWidget := XWT_Create( Self, XWT_TYPE_MyNiceWidget )
   IF .not. ::oRawWidget
      // signal error
   ENDIF

   // settin properties here: explained below
   ::cId := cId
   XWT_SetProperty( ::oRawWidget, XWT_TYPE_POSITION, nPosX, nPosY )
RETURN Self


  Accessing widgets: property calls
  ---------------------------------

XWT widgets are meant to be "flexible". An xwt widget could incorporate
several lower level widgets, or be a derivation or a combination of them.
Accessing data or managing lower widget status is responsibilit of the DRIVER
level. To request the DRIVER level to act on the widgets, the XWT INTERNAL
level calls the following functions:

BOOL xwt_drv_set_property( PXWT_WIDGET wSelf, PXWT_PROPERTY prop );
BOOL xwt_drv_get_property( PXWT_WIDGET wSelf, PXWT_PROPERTY prop );

PXWT_PROPERTY being a pointer to the following structure:

typedef struct tag_xwt_property
{
   int type;
   union {
      int number;
      XWT_POSITION position;
      XWT_SIZE size;
      XWT_RECT rect;
      BOOL setting;
      PXWT_WIDGET widget;
      const char *text;
      void *data;
   } value;
} XWT_PROPERTY, *PXWT_PROPERTY;


The "type" member is one of the XWT_PROP_* define in xwt.ch. The "value"
member will be of a kind that depends on property type, and could also be
unused.

The XWT_POSITION, XWT_SIZE and XWT_RECT structures are just commodity
structures defined as follows:

typedef struct tag_xwt_position
{
   int x;
   int y;
} XWT_POSITION, *PXWT_POSITION;

typedef struct tag_xwt_size
{
   int width;
   int height;
} XWT_SIZE, *PXWT_SIZE;

typedef struct tag_xwt_rect
{
   int x;
   int y;
   int width;
   int height;
} XWT_RECT, *PXWT_RECT;

The PRG Level function XWT_SetProperty() will take care to translate a
parameter list into a correctly filled XWT_PROPERTY structure, and then pass
it to the DRIVER level. The implementation of xwt_drv_set_property() is then
responsible to do something sensible with the request to set the property to a
certain value, interpreting also the content of the "value" field.

If the request is sucessfully processed, the function will return TRUE. If the
driver cannot fulfil the request, both because the property is meaningless if
applied to the passed widget, or because the property setting is still not
implemented, it will return FALSE.

* TODO: An error system helping to understand why a set_property call has
  failed.

The xwt_drv_get_property() function has the same meaning, but it set the
values inside the property structure, instead of reading them. As above, the
function can return FALSE if it is not able to set the property value, be it
because the property is meaningless for the widget, because of an underlying
widget api error or because of an incomplete implementation.

The PRG LEVEL function XWT_GetProperty() works as XWT_SetProperty, but it
receives parameters passed byref, that are then filled by the INTERNAL level
on sucessful return of xwt_drv_get_property().

  Example of property usage
  -------------------------

A typical implementation of DRIVER level get/set property functon for the
"text" property can be:

// BEGIN

#include "xwt_api.h"
#include "xwt.ch"
...

BOOL xwt_drv_set_property( PXWT_WIDGET wSelf, PXWT_PROPERTY prop )
{
   switch( prop->type )
   {
   ...
      case XWT_PROP_TEXT:
         switch( wSelf->type )
         {
            ...
            case XWT_TYPE_TEXTBOX:
               SetText( (HANDLE) wSelf->widget_data, prop->value.text );
            return TRUE;
            ...
         }

      // We have not found an adequate widget for set text
      return FALSE;
   }

   // We have not implemented that property at all
   return FALSE;
}

BOOL xwt_drv_get_property( PXWT_WIDGET wSelf, PXWT_PROPERTY prop )
{
   switch( prop->type )
   {
   ...
      case XWT_PROP_TEXT:
         switch( wSelf->type )
         {
            ...
            case XWT_TYPE_TEXTBOX:
               prop->value.text = GetText( (HANDLE) wSelf->widget_data );
            return TRUE;
            ...
         }

      // We have not found an adequate widget for get text
      return FALSE;
   }

   // We have not implemented that property at all
   return FALSE;
}

// END

A typical call from inside a PRG LEVEL widget can be:

METHOD SetText( cText ) CLASS MyTextBox
   IF .not. XWT_SetProperty( ::oRawWidget, XWT_PROP_TEXT, cText )
      ? "Cannot set text into my text box!"
      RETURN FALSE
   ENDIF
RETURN TRUE

METHOD GetText() CLASS MyTextBox
   LOCAL cText

   IF .not. XWT_GetProperty( ::oRawWidget, XWT_PROP_TEXT, @cText )
      ? "Cannot get text from my text box!"
      RETURN NIL
   ENDIF

RETURN cText

* NOTICE: Pointer based property (text and data) must be considered as owned
  by the driver and thus never being mangled directly at INTERNAL or PRG
  level.

* NOTICE: oRawWidget is a public member. Properties can be set or read also
  by the final PRG directly by calling i.e.

    XWT_SetProperty( oWidget:oRawWidget, XWT_PROP_TEXT, "Hello world" );

  This could change in the future, as the ownership of basic widget data
  (text, preferred size and position, etc.) is still under evaluation.


  Widget Hierarcy: Adding and removing widgets to widgets
  -------------------------------------------------------

XWT has an abstract class at PRG Level called XwtContainer: it holds an array
of owned widgets that are "logically" inside a parent widget. Also, each
widget has an oOwner member, that is filled with the current parent of the
widget, if it has any.

This logical ownership structure must be often (if not always) known by the
DRIVER level, that has to tell the underlying widgeting library about
ownership relationships.

Ownership could be often handled "on the fly" by the driver, by simply i.e.
propagating property settings to the objects stored in the aChildren member of
the parent object, but when those automatic mechanisms are already
implemented, it is far better to reflect the logical widget ownership
structure into the phisical layer.

This is done by calling the XWT_Add( oParent::oRawWidget, oChild::oRawWidget )
and XWT_Remove(oParent::oRawWidget, oChild::oRawWidget ) at PRG level. This
calls are translated into:

BOOL xwt_drv_add( PXWT_WIDGET wSelf, PXWT_WIDGET wChild );
BOOL xwt_drv_remove( PXWT_WIDGET wSelf, PXWT_WIDGET wChild );

That must be handled by the driver function, that should return FALSE if
adding/removing the child widget to the parent one is not possible, or TRUE
otherwise.


  Destroying widgets
  ------------------

Once the widget is not needed anymore, it must be destroyed. Since the widget
can be used later by the driver, or the PRG level widget can be used in
several ways by the PRG program, a direct call to XwtWidget:Destroy() is in
order. This will be transalted into a call to XWT_Destroy( Self:oRawWidget )
and the INTERNAL layer will translate it into

BOOL xwt_drv_destroy( PXWT_WIDGET wSelf );

This is to give the dirver the change to free any memory it can have allocated
to handle the low level widget, and to tell the underlying system that the
widget is going to be destroyed. The driver is also responsible to free the
wSelf XWT_WIDGET pointer, and this is a minimal operation that any driver must
care about.

Destruction of container is done by calling the Destroy() method of each
child, and then the Destroy() of the container. This gives the chance to
cleanly remove/destroy the widgets also if they are owned by other low level
widgets. In fact, most widget libraries have already an internal system that
destroys all the child widgets of a container, but this mechanism cannot be
relied upon as the XWT DRIVER layer could have something to say about it...
So, each child is cleanly destroyed, and the self-destruction mechanism of
lower level container widget system, if present, is never used.

A typical widget destruction routine is the following:

BOOL xwt_drv_destroy( PXWT_WIDGET wWidget )
{
   Hide( (HANDLE) wWidget->widget_data );
   CloseHandle( (HANDLE) wWidget->widget_data );
   if( wWidget->destructor != NULL )   {
      wWidget->destructor( wWidget->widget_data );
   }
   hb_xfree( wWidget );
   return TRUE;
}

(It is just a fantasy example); If the widget data is complex and can vary
from widget to widget, and if it must be allocated by the driver level, then
the specific xwt_drv_create() implementation can set a specific destructor
routine to simplify the job of the xwt_drv_destroy() routine. A switch() based
on the widget type can work pretty the same way, but this method is more
elegant.

* NOTICE: the raw widget data MUST be freed by the driver, as it could use a
  function of his own to allocate XWT_WIDGET strtucture.




THE EVENT SYSTEM
================

Events are the way that are used by the DRIVER level to communicate with the
XWT PRG, or with the final application, that something meaningful happened.
Sometimes, events are generated directly by the PRG level.

Event is a xHarbour class defined as:

CLASS XWTEvent
   DATA nType
   DATA oSender
   DATA aParams

   Method New( nType, oEmitter, aParams)
ENDCLASS

The event type is one of the XWT_E_* define in the xwt.ch file. oSender is the
widget sending the event, while the parameters are packed in an array that can
have length 0 if the event has no paramenter.

Each widget has three core methods that are meant to manage the event
system:

   oWidget:addListener( xFunction )  or
   oWidget:addListener( oListener, xMethod )
   oWidget:addEventListener( iEventType, xFunction ) or
   oWidget:addEventListener( iEventType, oListener, xMethod )
   oWidget:RiseEvent( oEvent ) --> bManaged

A listener function has this prototype:

   ListenerFunction( oEvent ) --> bManaged

A listener object, receiving the event in a method has the following
prototype:

   oListener:Method( oEvent ) --> bManaged


  Rising Events
  -------------

RiseEvent will call all the registered listener (first to last), providing
them with the received event, untill all the listeners are called or until a
listener returns TRUE, signaling that the event has been managed and should
not be forwarded further. A listener can also alter the event, or rise a new
event, and then return FALSE, so that the event will be sent to other
listener.

If all the registered listener return FALSE, or if the object rising
the event hasn't any listener, the event is then passed to the owner, if
present, by calling ::oOwner:RiseEvent( oEvent ).

RiseEvent returns TRUE if any listener or the owner's RiseEvent has returned
TRUE, or FALSE otherwise.

* TODO: a variable that inibiths propagation of the event to the owner.

At final application level, RiseEvent can be called directly, or by using the
utility function XWT_FastRiseEvent( oSender, iType, xParam1 ... xParamN ),
that will produce an event object only if the event is really sent to an owner
or processed by some listener, thus sparing useless creation and destruction
of the event object and parameters array.

* NOTICE: the parameters stored in the parameters array might also differ
  depending on the widget rising the events. I.e. a button does not signals
  where the mouse has clicked  it, while "sensible" image does.


  Listening to events
  -------------------

AddListener() and addEventListener() are methods that allow any kind of
callable item to be used as event notification listeners.

* TODO: InsertListener() to allow placing an event listener at any given
  position, i.e. before already registered listeners.

The difference among the two is that the latter method, AddEventListener(),
has an integer as the first parameter that is the XWT_E_* event type that will
cause that listener to be called. A listener registered with AddListener()
will be called each time an event is risen by the target object, while
AddEventListener will call only those functions that are registered fot that
specific event type. A callable item can be registered any time to the same
object, so it is possible to have a listener for more than one event type, but
not for all, by calling AddEventListener() several time.

Callable items that can be registered are:

- Codeblocks
- Function names (stored in a string)
- Function references ( e.g. @MyListener() )
- Objects followed by a method name (stored in a string)
- Objects followed by a method pointer, obtained by
   HB_ObjMsgPtr( Object, "MtdName" )

Examples:

   MyButton:AddListener( @ManageButtonEvents() )
   MyButton:AddEventListener( XWT_E_CLICKED, MyButton, "MethodIamClicked" )

Althoug function and method names can give greater flexibility, and the
ability to create specific listeners at runtime, they are far less efficient
than the compile time @() and HB_ObjMsgPtr() counterparts, so use them
cautiously.

A listener can be registered to more than one widgets; the Event::oSender item
allows to understand which object generated the event, as Event::iType allows
to understand what kind of event is passed to the listener.

  Removing Listeners
  ------------------

Removing a listener can be done simply by calling

   oWidget::RemoveListener( xCallable [, xMethod ] )

All the listening items will be removed at once, even if registered more than
one time. It is necessary to remove a listener using the same xCallable (and
eventually xMethod) used to register it. E.g., calling AddListener( "Func" )
and RemovedListener( @Func() ) won't work


  Rising events from within the DRIVER layer
  ------------------------------------------

When something interesting happens inside the DRIVER, it should rise an event
to advertise the situation up to the PRG layer. An utility function stored in
xwt_api.c helps in this duty:

   int xwt_rise_event( PHB_ITEM pObject, int EventType, int argc, ... );

pObject is the object sending the event, EventType is one of the XWT_E_*
macros stored in xwt.ch, and argc is the number of parameters passed in the
event parameter array. Those parameters must be PHB_ITEM created by the
function calling xwt_rise_event(); they can be both in the stack or
dynamically allocated.

One counter-intuitive thing is that also the pObject must be created by the
calling function. In fact, xHarbour stores the REAL object inside the
item.asArray.value element of the xHarbour object. The PHB_ITEM that the PRG
layer could pass down to the driver i.e. during widget creation is just a
SHELL for the real object, a shell that can be discarded and destroyed soon
after the return of the function that is willing to register a call back.

So, if you need to store an object for i.e. rising an event from it in a later
moment, you must record its asArray value, not the object itself: you must
record the real object, not its shell.

Here is a tipical code to record an object and later rise an event to it:

PXWT_WIDGET xwt_MyDriver_createTextbox( PHB_ITEM pSelf )
{
   PXWT_WIDGET xwtData;
   MyTextboxStruct *MyTextbox = (allocating a new MyTextbox structure here );

   MyTextbox->owner = pSelf->item.asArray.value;
   MyTextbox->Handle = ( creating a valid textbox widget here );
   xwtData->widget_data = MyTextbox;
   xwtData->type = XWT_TYPE_TEXTBOX;

   return xwtData;
}

static void box_changed( PXWT_WIDGET wSelf )
{
   HB_ITEM String;
   HB_ITEM Self;
   MyTextboxStruct *MyTextbox = (MyTextboxStruct *) wSelf->widget_data;

   Self.type = HB_IT_ARRAY;
   Self.item.asArray.value = MyTextbox->owner;

   hb_itemPutC( &String, GetText( MyTextbox->Handle ) );
   xwt_rise_event( &Self, XWT_E_CHANGED, 1, &String );
}

xwt_rise_event will create the event object and then call the RiseEvent method
only if this is meaningful for the target object.
