   - Removed component DataConnection
   + Added full SQL support
   + Added new BindingSource component
     it connects to the specified SQL Server or AutoDetect based
     on the ConnectionString.
   + Added BindingSource property to DataTable
   + Added support for drivers SQLRDD and SQLEX
   + Added new "Socket" property to DataTable
     When assigning a Socket component, DataTable sends requests to the
     specified host in the Socket component in the following format:
        'SOCKETRDD|Request|MyTABLEALIAS|dbSeek|"cData"|.F.'
        When the server receives the string it must macro convert the
        parameter list starting at the 5th element i.e:
            aReceived := hb_aTokens( Sender:RecData, "|" )
            cParams := ""
            FOR i := 5 TO LEN( aReceived )
                cParams += aReceived[i] + IIF( i < 5, ",", "" )
            NEXT
            This creates a string like this: ""cData",.F." so the function
            in the server can be called like this: dbSkip( &cParams )

  * Library/source/Window.prg
    * Changed default control names to be UNIQUE in the form
    * Changed event name generation based in unique name
    + Added children definition to FORM
  explanation:
    Like VS does, all controls no matter the parent belong to the form also events get generated that way
    i.e.
      Form1
         |_ Button1           METHOD Button1_OnClick( Sender ) CLASS Form1
         |_ GroupBox1
            |_ Button2        METHOD Button2_OnClick( Sender ) CLASS Form1
            |_ Button3        METHOD Button3_OnClick( Sender ) CLASS Form1
            |_ GroupBox2
               |_ Button4     METHOD Button4_OnClick( Sender ) CLASS Form1

    Also nested objects are accessed from both Parent and Form for compatibility

      METHOD Button4_OnClick( Sender ) CLASS Form1

         ALERT( ::GroupBox1:GroupBox2:Button4:Caption )

         or simply

         ALERT( ::Button4:Caption )

     ! Reinstated Ron's fix for the xHDN page.

2006-03-05 05:08 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <augusto.infante@xHarbour.com>

  Changed the way control names are generated exactly like MSVS using one UNIQUE name in the form
  just like MSVS does to avoid long event METHOD names. i.e.

  Previously an OnClick for a Button on a TabPage on a TabControl on a GroupBox on a Panel on a TabControl on a TabPage would be:

  METHOD TabControl1_TabPage1_Panel1_GroupBox1_TabControl1_TabPage1_Button1_OnClick

  as you can see it is too long unless you rename the event and it causes in some cases
  the compiler to GPF due to 64 chars limitation. But let's do it the MSVS way

  Add a Button on the form = Button1
  Add a Button on a TabPage on a TabControl on a GroupBox = Button2
  Add a Button on the form again = Button3

  So the event for Button2 would be:

  METHOD Button2_OnClick

  Now VXH behaves the same way, no harm is caused to previously generated applications
  because the property is saved in the XFM (thanks Ron - Good Idea, it saved my day)

  I still have to unify all components (MenuItems, GridColums, etc ... ) so some crashes are expected
  but from now on the average event will look like this: Button2_OnClick.

      speed and better memory management.
      Since this was a BIG change problems are EXPECTED, I've tried to give it a STRESS test and everything
      seems to be working perfectly.

  + Added compatibility with previous objects
    NOTE: Users will get an error building the application to avoid this they MUST manually add
          the instance class:

                    CLASS %formname% FROM m_%formname%
                    ENDCLASS

          previous code:
          GLOBAL EXTERNAL Application

          #include "vxh.ch"
          #include "Form1.xfm"
          //---------------------------------------- End of system code ----------------------------------------//

          //----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
          METHOD Button1_OnClick( Sender ) CLASS m_Form1


          New code:
          GLOBAL EXTERNAL Application

          #include "vxh.ch"
          #include "Form1.xfm"
          //---------------------------------------- End of system code ----------------------------------------//

          //----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

    + Added user CLASS management for FORMS
      This fix makes all previous projects fail to load because of compatibility issues.
      The form gets deployed in XFM file by adding "m_" to the FORM NAME i.e.

      Name = "testForm"

      XFM shows:

      CLASS m_testForm INHERIT Form

      PRG shows:

      #include "testForm.xfm"  <<<<< See that filename doesn't change

      CLASS testForm FROM m_testForm   <<<<<< Notice that testForm is used as real CLASS inheritting previous m_testForm
      ENDCLASS

      Now users can even use the events other than from event manager:

      CLASS testForm FROM m_testForm
         DATA MyData EXPORTED  <<<<< Finally user variables can be added
         METHOD OnPaint()
      ENDCLASS

      METHOD OnPaint() CLASS testForm

  !Fixed DateGrid Field Edition
  !Fixed lock up in Components Panel
   The previous code was wrong but only allowed because of previous child property
   management which was ilegal for xH.
   Problem: We cannot delete children while processing Children array, WM_DESTROY is fired
            during that destroy and the Children element is automaticaly deleted
            Catch 22 ?.
   The fix: Add those objects to another array and then delete objects in that local array.
      aChildren := {}
      FOR n := 1 TO LEN( ::Children )
          IF ::Children[n]:ClsName == "Button"
             AADD( aChildren, ::Children[n] )

  * Library\Source\TabControl
    !Fixed nasty bug executing commands in TabPages due to previous parent changes
     reverted SetParent to TabControl's Parent
  * IDE\Source\vxh1.prg
    - Removed InvokeDebugger flag
    - Removed Debugger button in Toolbar
    + Added RunMode flag
    + Added ComboBox to Toolbar ( VS complaint )
      Options:
         Test:
             Saves, Compiles, builds and run in TEMP folder
             No Build listbox is shown **UNLESS** ERROR
             ( modified flag remains ACTIVE * to ask the user to save )

             ( Good to monitor the application without saving changes ) ( Dave's idea )

         Debug:
             Same as "Test" but Debugger is invoked

         Release:
             Saves, Compiles, builds and run in **PROJECT** folder
             Build listbox is SHOWN
             No Debugger is invoked.

    STATIC struname
    DEFAULT struname TO (struct STRUNAME)
    struname:Pointer( nlParam )

    with:

    LOCAL struname
    struname := (struct STRUNAME*) nlParam

    This issue appears to be cause of my headaches.



2005-04-30 07:45 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
  LOCK UP ISSUE:
  I couldn't believe I wasn't able to DOCK right after the handle was created, so I re-enabled
  that and got the old lock up again, so I started from scratch revising and testing all the
  controls in VXH until I got to TABCONTROL.
  After 3 days of fighting and being Saturday 7:36 am no sleep at all, I FOUND IT !!!!
  I first disabled FLAT effects on Tabs and lock was gone, so I enabled flat again and
  went STRAIGHT to my painting procedure and started RETURN 0 until I finally got the lock up
  again in this line:

  SendMessage( ::hWnd, TCM_ADJUSTRECT, 0, @rc )

  so I replaced it with old line:

     _SendMessage( ::hWnd, TCM_ADJUSTRECT, 0, rc:Value )
     rc:Devalue()

  and guess what not only lock is gone, now tabs get perfectly relocated if they are MULTILINE

  Ron, what seemed to be an infinit loop, turned out to be a silent GPF caused in SendMessage()
  in WinAPI.c, you know better how to trace inside C code so if you want to do it ( although it works
  it can cause problems to users later on ) the code is in:

  Library\TabControl.prg line # 437

  Now it's stable

  IDE/Source/Vxh1.prg
    + Added logic to detect modified external file or project program
    + Added logic to prompt for SAVE, ONLY if it is an external program and NOT ADDED to project
      files added to project will be saved together with the whole project
      To ADD a program to the project, the file MUST has previously been saved.
    - Removed Application:Run line from starting Main buffer
      The project MIGHT not be a Windows project so those lines will automatically be added on FIRST NEW FORM request.
      This allows us to create other kind of projects like SERVICES applications
  IDE/Source/Vxh2.prg
    + Added logic to ADD Application:Run line on NEW FORM, ONLY if [BEGIN SYSTEM CODE] is not found AND right before last RETURN + CRLF line

  Climbed release version to 9.1 ( Please re-publish, those changes are necesary to test this version )

2005-04-17 10:04 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
  ! Fixed Form position bug when designer is scrolled problem generated by new Mask
  * Sync'd File Menu to show different Close / Save / Save As options and change corresponding actions depending
    on currently selected TAB. ie.

    When a source is selected:
         ( program name changes depending on selected editor )
      Close MyProgram.prg
      Save MyProgram.prg
      Save MyProgram.prg As ...

    When Designer is selected or no source is being edited
      Close Project
      Save Project
      Save Project As ...

    + METHOD GetTabPosByName( cName ) CLASS TabControl
      This will retrieve the index position based on the tab name, needed since ( fake ) pages
      for Editors are not objects but API.
  * IDE/Source/Vxh4.prg
    * Modified METHOD RenameForm() and RenameEvent() to use new function ChangePrgLine()
      which respects all comments and changes only active values.
      Now Tab is renamed based on OLD name using GetTabPosByName() instead of saving position in form,
      this is mandatory since now ALL editors can be closed no matter if they belong to the project or not

         Application:SourceEditor:oEditor:Save()
      RETURN Self

NEXT IS [ADD TO PROJECT] [REMOVE FROM PROJECT] Project files will contain an ICON in it corresponding TAB.

      This method updates the system line in main project prg by
      *** DELETING *** lines between [BEGIN SYSTEM CODE] and [END SYSTEM CODE] and *** INSERTING ***
      Application( NIL ):Run( Form1( NIL ), HB_aParams() ) WITH the new MAIN Form name
      ( useful also when renaming main form, not done yet )

      PROCEDURE Main( ... )

      //-------------- [BEGIN SYSTEM CODE] *** User code below this line is not allowed *** --------//
         Application( NIL ):Run( Form1( NIL ), HB_aParams() )

2005-03-28 21:54 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
  * Library/source/DataGrid.prg
    + Added support for GridColumn EVENTS, Yes, GridColumns started to fire events like OnImageIndex() this one is fired on every record
      ImageIndex will be valid *UNLESS* OnImageIndex() returns another value
      i.e.

      WITH OBJECT ( :GridColumn2 := GRIDCOLUMN( :this ) )
          :ImageIndex           :=          1  <<<<<<<<<<<<--------------  IMAGE INDEX IS SET TO 1

    ! Fixed bug returning to corresponding record number in method Update()
  * IDE\Source\vxh1.prg
    ! Fixed GenerateChild() to generate ImageList component
    ! Fixed ParseXFM() to load ImageList component and corresponding images
      ( this one was previously done for previous XFM file, I guess some components might be lost with new XFM,
        I'll go fixing as they appear )

2005-03-26 21:29 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
  * Library/source/TabControl.prg
    * Modified TabPage to be a modeless child dialog and be able to

      Texure
  * IDE\Source\vxh1.prg
  * IDE\Source\vxh4.prg
  * IDE\Source\vxh9.prg
    + Added Project tree navigation and control selection from Project Tree one of they new toys
      include Auto Form changing i.e. if the selected control is within another container (Form/TabPage),
      that container is selected then the control.

2005-03-19 20:29 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
  * IDE\Source\vxh1.prg
    * Increased release number to 8.3
  * Library/source/DataBase.prg
    + Added property AREA
    * Modified INLINE methods to point to ( ::Area )-> instead of ( ::Alias )
      feels more accurate
  * Library/source/DataGrid.prg
    * replaced DataSource access codeblocks for METHODS ( i.e. ::Skip() instead of ::bSkip )
    ! Fixed bug setting current position on mouse click
    ! DataGrid works for any kind of DataBase driver, also tested multiple DataGrids on a single form
      also tested behavior with component MemoryTable.
  * Library/source/Window.prg
    ! Fixed GPF cleaning Dock and Anchor on form destroy.
    ! Fixed bug in OnVertScroll
      to be fired *AFTER* retrieving nTrackPos from structure ( 32 bits )
      instead of sending HiWord( nwParam ) ( 16 bits )
    Now VERY LARGE databases can be browsed with SB_THUMBTRACK *WITHOUT* loosing current position

2005-03-15 10:45 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <Ron in xHarbour.com>
  * IDE\Source\Vxh1.prg

2005-03-10 00:55 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
  * Library\source\DataGrid.prg
    !Fixed bug painting empty area when Control is bigger than Columns
    * Modified GridColumn Selection rectangle to be selected ONLY from the header, leaving the body to select the DataGrid
      This is mandatory under 2 conditions:
      1) If DataGrid has no SmallCaption the control MUST be able to be selected from the body
      2) If DataGrid has NO DATA the columns cannot be selected other than from the Header.
         ... plus I like it better now ;-)
  * Library\source\DataBase.prg
    - Removed property PreAlias used in old DataBase component, this was causing real property ALIAS to be
      override causing dbUseArea() to use database name as alias and not the one set in Object Manager.
    * Modified Property Alias
    + Added method SetAlias() to close the database, change the Alias and re-open inline
    * Modified Property FileName
    + Added method SetFileName
      Now FileName can be changed on the fly and DataGrid will detect the change and change all the contents
      ONLY in Design time, later on we can se if we could leave that for Runtime.
      This a real nice example of how to use HB_QSelf()
  * Library\source\WinAPI.c
    + FUNCTION GetTickCount()


  PLUS !! all fixes in beta.vxh that because it's too late and my back hurts I don't enumerate



2005-03-08 18:31 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <Ron in xHarbour.com>
  * IDE\Source\Vxh1.prg
    * Fixed generation of REQUEST <rdd>

2005-03-08  2:51 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   !Finished ToolTip Support
   !Fixed bug deleting forms

2005-03-06 10:31 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   !Fixed Components events ( sounds strange ? ) yes, Timers are components and they fire events
    Added logic to be generated and fired with new XFM.

2005-03-06 00:34 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   * Library\Source\DataGrid.prg
     * Modified GridColumn to be selected on Designer
   !Fixed Designer to correctly reset Clipboard ToolBar and Edit Menu
   !Fixed Bug generating GridColumns XFM
   !Fixed Designer to add move mark rectangle in mask ONLY if the control allows it and ONLY the
    points allowed by the selected control i.e. DataGrid's GridColumn will only add a mark
    on the middle/right just to size with, Buttons the 8 marks and so on.
   !Fixed Designer's move/size cursors to be changed ONLY when the corresponding mark is visible
   !Fixed Designer to display MOVE cursor ONLY when selected control is "lMoveable"
   - Reversed Accelerators for Copy/Cut/Paste and set them as OnKeyDown() in Designer due to
     conflicts in xEdit WM_COMMAND. Fixed.
   !Fixed Shell:OpenDialog() bug selecting 1 file in multiselection mode
   !Fixed ImageList Inspector.
   !Fixed RTE pressing arrow keys on empty for in Designer

2005-03-05 05:54 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   * Library\Source\DataGrid.prg
     - Removed property AutoColumns
       DataGrid:AutoAddColumns() is fired as soon as a DataSource is assigned to DataGrid
       this is done for Columns reference ONLY, this way the user has the columns on the Grid, once generated
       the code generator will generate all the columns for the grid, NOT NEEDING AutoColumn at all.
     ! Fixed GridColum generation
       Works almost like a regular control, this fixes pasting DataGrids and will allow me to SELECT columns like if they
       were controls.
     - Removed duplicated array Columns, only Children is valid

   * IDE\Source\vxh1.prg
     !Fixed parser to check on the property it's about to assign
      In some cases, properties come like this i.e. :Form:DataBase1, :Form:ImageList1
      so cWithProperty := ":Form:ImageList1", If we call &cWithProperty, ":" has no reference so error is fired
      fixed includes:

      IF UPPER( LEFT( cWithValue, 6 ) ) == ":FORM:"
         cWithValue := STRTRAN( cWithValue, ":Form:" ) // REMOVE :Form:
         xValue := oObj:Form:&cWithValue // call the REAL value form CURRENT object ( oObj ) FORM

       ELSE
         xValue := &cWithValue
      ENDIF
      __objSendMsg( oObj, "_" + cWithProperty, xValue )  // Set the value

      !Fixed bug generating forms ( cWindow += ::GenerateControl( ...  NOTICE " += " so all the forms' edit buffers
       will be cumulative, so the very first line of a form should be: cWindow := ::GenerateControl( ...  NOTICE " := "
       this ensures the EDIT BUFFER for every form will be unique, also fixes LOADING such buffer and not get duplications.

   Still pending bug in forms buffer when deleting forms, something is wrong in the deletion.
   Still pending Editor shortcut keys, I guess it comes after added REAL ACCELERATORS.

   !Fixed Event Handler, some events like ComboBox weren't being fired
   !Finished EventHandler generation for CoolMenuItems
   Up and runnuing
   Started plugging in new Parser ( Thanks Ron, you saved me a lot of work, although the XFM change
                                    looked simple on first draft, It took a lot of changing and coding )

   !Finished Event generation for new XFM files
    Found Hash function HGetPos() which is faster than TRY in millions of messages per second those errors inside TRY
    delay the application 500% to say something in fact, VXH was impossible to run until:

    nRet := ExecuteEvent( "OnLButtonDown", Self )

    FUNCTION ExecuteEvent( cEvent, oObj )
       LOCAL cFormEvent, nRet

       IF HGetPos( oObj:EventHandler, cEvent ) != 0 <<<<====== THIS LINE SAVED THE DAY
          cFormEvent := oObj:EventHandler[ cEvent ]
          IF !( oObj:hWnd == oObj:Form:hWnd )
             nRet := oObj:Form:&cFormEvent( oObj )
           ELSE
             nRet := oObj:&cFormEvent( oObj )
          ENDIF
       ENDIF
    RETURN nRet

    A good test is to declare "OnLButtonUp" for a "FORM"
                              "OnClick"     for a "BUTTON"

    Check the XFM file and axecute, pay attention to event declaration "OnLButtonUp" for a "FORM" !!!!

   !Fixed problem re-painting Components panel
   !Fixed bug in code generator not saving changes in logical properties

2005-02-24  2:56 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   - Removed keydown handler for CTRL + C / X / V
     They're now handled by the system ( New Accelerators )
   * Library\Source\Window.prg
     !Fixed bug destroying components
  * IDE\Source\Vxh5.prg
    + Added Clipboard controls refresh when selecting Components, Components cannot be cut / copied.

2005-02-24 12:02 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   * Library\Source\Application.prg
     + METHOD AddAccelerators()
     + METHOD DelAccelerators()
     + METHOD TranslateAccelerator()
     * METHOD Run() to call METHOD TranslateAccelerator() instead of API.

   - REMOVED Application Accelerators
   + Added EVERYBODY'S DREAM !!!
     + Private accelerators i.e.
       Form1:AddAccekerator( FVIRTKEY | FCONTROL, ASC( "O" ), 1515 )
       Form2:AddAccekerator( FVIRTKEY | FCONTROL, ASC( "O" ), 2515 )

       Notice that in standard accelerator table you cannot do that, you will only have 1 event fired

       New method allowes us to execute the same key conbination pointing to different IDs

       The next change is to NOT to pass an ID as a 3rd parameter since IDs are automatic in VXH, instead
       the object as following:

       ::Parent:AddAccekerator( FVIRTKEY | FCONTROL, ASC( "O" ), Self )
       or
       ::AddAccekerator( FVIRTKEY | FCONTROL, ASC( "O" ), ::Button1 )

   !Fixed VXH File Menu Accelerators because of above


2005-02-23 2:17 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>

   ( and I wasn't going to work )
   :-)

   * xEdit\xeditlib.prg
     * Restored xedit.ini support under VXH

   * xEdit\xeditlib.prg
     ! Fixed silly typo that broke comments coloring.
     * Reduced KB accelerator factor to 2, since it's just too fast.

2005-02-22 4:18 UTC-0800 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
  ! Restructured all editting system
  - Removed CLASS UserModule
    No more Module:Functions now all event names are in the same EVENTS array on each object
    No more Module:Buffer now editting buffer is on each form ( CurrentWindow:UserBuffer )
    No more initial text or empty spaces at the begining since NOW the form initializes the buffer on Init with:
    ::UserBuffer := "GLOBAL EXTERNAL Application" + CRLF + CRLF +;
                    '#include "vxh.ch"' + CRLF +;
                    '#include "' + ::Name +'.xfm"' + CRLF +;
                    "//---------------------------------------- End of system code ----------------------------------------//" + CRLF + CRLF + CRLF
    Loding projects of course overrides initial settings
    ! Reduced METHOD GenerateEvent to almost nothing
    - Removed METHOD DeleteEvent since the only needed procedure is Event[2] := "" because the event IS in element 2 in Events array
    * Modified METHOD RenameEvent to almost nothing

      Event oriented methods' functionality is to ONLY change / Add editting buffer, such buffer is handled
      by the form it self, and the form it self and corresponding nested objects have their own EVENTS array.

    ! Fixed parser to ONLY assign Event[2] := cPureText loading events
      and to assign the corresponding oWnd:UserBuffer := oFile:FileBuffer
      The rest of code is been deleted

    !Fixed code generator to not to scan for METHODS in external objects ( ex Modules ) but to grab it from their own Events array
     Also removed        oFile:FileBuffer := IIF( nModule > 0 .AND. ( '#include "' + ::CurrentWindow:Name +'.xfm"' + CRLF ) $ ::Modules[n]:Buffer, CRLF + ::Modules[ nModule ]:Buffer, ;
                                                                                 'GLOBAL EXTERNAL Application' + CRLF + CRLF +;
                                                                                 '#include "vxh.ch"' + CRLF +;
                                                                                 '#include "' + ::Windows[n]:Name +'.xfm"' + CRLF +;
                                                                                 "//---------------------------------------- End of system code ----------------------------------------//" + CRLF + CRLF + CRLF )

     LOOK AT THE CURRENT LINE :-)
                                   oFile:FileBuffer := ::Windows[n]:UserBuffer

      ( isn't it better ???? )

     Now it's everything is clear, modifying XFM was a clear idea but then again, the code was too fragil to start touching it
     not only parser and generator were included in such change but all buffer editting and event handlers were too touchy and I was
     afraid of breaking it all in the process so now I have my own GREEN LIGHT to modify any code I want.

     The code is stable and strong.

     NICE JOB AUGUSTO ( SORRY TO CHEER UP MY SELF BUT I DESERVE IT :-) ),
     This is something I really needed to DO LONG TIME AGO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   Struggled for 2 days to get to memory leak openning large projects but I found that it's not
   VXH but it could be xHb ( xcc ) I'd like to test building everything with bcc to see what happens,
   I will only need TProject built with bcc, guess the rest will be xHarbour CVS, I based my tests on
   creating the same test with my old Wow.lib and no leak, I could build vxh.lib using CVS ... Ron ?

2005-02-16 03:06 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   !General clean up trying to find the memory leak opening large projects
    The big problem happens opening forms after 50 forms +/-
    I already tried creating 100 forms using nothing but API and it is fine
    The problem comes with either the objects or the structures
    I tested opening 100 "object" forms and the leak is there
    I made the same test on my old Wow library almost the same objects yet and there's no memory leak
    I assume that since Andy made his own Structures, that must be it

    Ron, could you please take a look at Structures to see if there can be a memory leak there ?

    Thanks

   * IDE/Source/Vxh2.prg

       ONLY draging with mouse down is how a control is dropped
       This works only by button UP this way Form doesn't confuse with mouse down and change
       Object Manager's ActiveObject.

       4 Hours fix but was worth it, now it behaves as it should ( thanks Dave )

   * IDE/Source/Vxh6.prg

2005-01-15  2:40 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   ! Fixed Flicker problems
   ! Fixed ImageList support in ToolBars
     I suggest, the usage is selecting the Imagelist component in toolbar from the property ImageList when the ToolBar
     is hosted by a Band, since the band is NOT a control ( no handle ) I cannot find it with the mouse, however, ImageList
     can be dropped into a ToolBar when this is not HOSTED by a Band YET, then Set BandChild with ToolBar# and will all go together
     to the CoolBar

   ! Fixed Controls / Components focus issues
   + Added "Add Button" to context menu in toolbars
   + Added "Remove Band" to context menu in Coolbars

   ALMOST DONE
   SUGGESTION:
               I have overworked my self to get this really nice working, VXH is stable and complete enough to achieve a
               Beta 1 in days, let's release Preview 3 and dedicate 30 days to patch and fix what's already done.
               that way, Beta 1 will be a strong and stable version of current code.

   Sorry no file detailed ChangeLog because I have touched almost all the files and would be impossible to document every single patch.


2005-01-13 22:52 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   + Added property XPTheming T/F to add or remove XP theme to controls
   + Added Menu Remove Band in coolbar's context menu

    * Accelerated Designer pixels, still have some flicker

2005-01-12 20:31 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
    ! Stabilized Designer
    + Added support for CoolBarBands, Right click on CoolBarBand pops menu "Add CoolBarBand"
      So far it will just work on the very left side of the visible part not occupied by
      CoolMenu or ToolBars or controls, further development will add "Add CoolBarBand to CoolBar"
      on right click on HOSTED controls in Bands.
    * Finishing logic to setup Toolbars

2005-01-09 20:31 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
    ! Finished Errors Tab

    * IDE/Source/Vxh2.prg
      ! Fixed Page selection in TabControl

2005-01-06 22:38 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
    ! Finished ImageList Component
      Automaticaly generates resource entries in .rc
      Parser reads ImageList
      ImageList Manager reads physical file instead of resource
      for graphical display in IDE
      VXH Allows dropping the ImageList Component into the control or simply
          select from the ComboBox property ImageList that contains all ImageLists
          on the Parent.
      DataGrid and Button have the propery ImageList PUBLISHED
      Still need to check on the rest of the controls especially ToolBar
      the LAST step is to Add and remove Buttons from the ToolBar
      I "might" create a ToolBar manager or simply try to select each button with a click.


2005-01-06 11:45 UTC+0100 Patrick Mast <patrick@xHarbour.com>
    * IDE/Source/vxh1.prg

        RETURN

     * Library/source/Application.prg
       + Added "Params" method
       * Changed Run() Method to receive startup parameters
         Now we can receive parameters from build applications via:
         Application:Params

2005-01-05 21:46 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>

       to its parent and sets CenterImage to TRUE, the image will automaticaly Center in main screen

2005-01-02 15:37 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   * Fixed some cosmetics for component drop cursor and component button rectangle
     when it's not properly selected.

2005-01-01 16:37 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
   Finished Control Picture
   Includes following formats:

    "Portable Network Graphics (*.png)
    "JPEG (*.jpg,*.jif,*.jpeg,*.jpe)
    "Windows Metafile (*.wmf)
    "Windows Enhanced Metafile (*.emf)

    PENDING RESOURCE GENERATION, so far it only works with EXTERNAL files although LoadPic.c is ready to load images from
                                 resource, it will be a little bit complicated to organize resource generation from file
                                 and get rid of the FileName property once the resource is created, also must delete the resource
                                 in case of changing the image

    Also added support for KeepAspectRatio, I did that during the 20 days off ;-)

    Added to ToolBox, tested, Working

    * Modified CASE WM_DRAWITEM to use:
                                   pPtr := GetProp( ::DrawItemStruct:hwndItem, "PROP_CLASSOBJECT" )
                                   oCtrl := ARRAYFROMPOINTER( pPtr )
                                instead of:
                                   ( n := ASCAN( ::Children, {|o|o:hWnd == ::DrawItemStruct:hwndItem} ) ) > 0

  NOTE: Will finish ImageList tomorrow but we HAVE to decide if the Image file I'm browsing will be a single Image File
        or it will be converted to a RESOURCE entry.

    + Started ImageList Manager

2004-12-22 20:00 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
  * Library/source/Window.prg
    * METHOD DockIt() CLASS Window
      Set 3rd parameter to TRUE ( lMoveNow ) on call to OnParentSize to avoid use of:

      BeginDeferWindowPos()
      DeferWindowPos()
      EndDeferWindowPos()

      and simply use SetWindowPos() since it is JUST one object to be moved

    + Added logic to check *IF* the handle is VALID

  Patrick, Ron:

  It's nice to see that you can manage the code easily, however, the only reason for Window.prg #2431 to work is because
  VIEW ( debug ) refreshes the application, it's a Good! aproach though, I have commented out the VIEW line and removed the calls
  for buffering windows positions (BeginDeferWindowPos - EndDeferWindowPos) and passed TRUE as a 3rd parameter, OnParentSize() uses
  SetWindowPos() insteand of DeferWindowPos() if lMoveNow is TRUE ( see line # 2622 ).
  hDef is a pointer to an internal array of objects, BeginDeferWindowPos( 1 ) means that only 1 object will be moved when
  EndDeferWindowPos() is fired, this way I have managed to move all the controls at once ( see WM_SIZE ) when the parent is sized
  so the problem is not there, yet, it might be born there, the thing is that we should check if the HWND handle is valid especially
  the editor's since its creation might be delayed for some reason.

  As you might know, I couldn't keep my hands off the keyboard these 20 days, eventhought I wasn't online, I have managed to finish:

  1) ToolBar
  2) ImageList
  3) DataGrid ( added MultiSelect, MultiLine in a single cell, Array browsing )
  4) MemoryTable (component)
  5) AdsDataBase (component)
  6) Started SQL (component) but I think I will need more time to finish this one
  7) Save As
  8) Multiple control Selection to enable copy button and menu item
  9) Started IntelliSence support in INHERITANCE of xEdit

  These addons and fixes have modified a lot of code all around VXH library, no harm done to the IDE but it will take me
  a few days to finish merging and posting.


  Happy Holidays!

  Augusto

  * Restablished property ANCHOR I was doing it right, this is the definition of Anchor from MS:

     A control can be anchored to one or more edges of its parent container.
     Anchoring a control to its parent ensures that the anchored edges remain in the same position
     relative to the edges of the parent container when the parent container is resized.
     For example, if you have a Form with a Button whose Anchor property value is set to
     AnchorStyles.Top and AnchorStyles.Bottom, the Button is stretched to maintain the anchored distance
     to the top and bottom edges of the Form as the Height of the Form is increased.

    FIXED and tested !

  * Modified Menu "View", removed old options, started it with Item "Grid"
  * Modified Designer to work with or without Grid
  - Removed Properties Dock and Anchor for NON-CHILD forms or controls, ONLY those with parents are able to Dock or Anchor.
    This also fixes

   ! Fixed Select Window ComboBox when Window property name changes ( visually )
   - Unpublished Parent Property
   - Unpublished Window Registration name will add Custom controls and forms
   ! Fixed Wrong Current Object display when Project loaded
     THIS ACCELERATED PROJECT OPEN, that one was intriging for me, just realized that I have to update the inspector
     just once while loading a project and JUST for Window1 ( MainWindow )

   ! Fixed Wrong Current Form name display in Select Window ComboBox when Project loaded
   - Unpublished Property PROPERTY due to internal xHarbour problems deleting the DATA, it deletes properties
     with the same name in other controls i.e. __objDelData( TabControl1, TabPage1 ) will delete the reference
     to Object Manager TabPage1 VERY DANGEROUS !!!.

     Ron maybe you could find the way to simply RENAME a DATA in a class ???
      ( that would make my day )

     to show something other than Window1, I have added CAPTION to the ComboBox Selector

       i.e. Select Window [ Customers            Window1 ]
                          [ Products             Window2 ]

   !Finished MDI engine
   + MDI Client Window gets generated with the rest of Children
   * IDE\vxh2.prg
     + Added METHOD SelectControl to be able to move the selection engine from outside the Window Editor
   * Library\Window.prg
     * Modified METHOD SetParent to be OBJECT compliant only
     * Modified Property creation to re-use deleted names

   * IDE\vxh1.prg
     + Added single instance for every window
     * Modified method Create() to Call constructor Init() if lInitialized is FALSE
       See following code results:

     ! Initializing a window with an INIT PROC works fine the first time you call the window
       using the GLOBAL variable, however once you close that window the object does not exist
       anymore and fails to create the next time.

      ! Tested MS C#, MS C++, Delphi 7 ALL OF THEM Call Forms creating a NEW INSTANCE to the object
        and a new handle unless the calling parent is disabled today's fixes make the code Windows compatible.

        Correct calling line should look as follow:

             FUNCTION Window1Button1OnClick( this )
                Window2( this:Parent )
             RETURN NIL

        The instance is created just like I've always did with or without the IDE, if you keep the parent
        enabled and click the button again, another class is initialized and another handle is created.

        + Added property DisableParent to disable the parent on execution

2004-07-23 04:02 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>
  * vxh1.prg
    + Initialized Children Combobox, this will be mandatory, I've been trying to do it by selecting the child with a single click
      it's ok on the form but impossible when the parent is a control in the form so selecting them from the Combobox is the
      right thing to do ( see MS Visual Studio, Delphi )

  * vxh4.prg
    ! Fixed GPF when selecting CoolBar ... this took me 3 hours I had to use SetUnhandledExceptionFilter to find the problem
      Found the GPF when trying to study the idea to setup a CoolMenu over a CooBar
    * Improved Navigation, Click and Double click on both Managers
    ! Fixed CtrlMask to NOT to be part of Children Array ( bothers code generation and several processes )
    + PUBLISHED property PARENT as a ComboBox to be able to change parents ( i.e. GroupBoxes or ComboBoxes set to ToolBars )
    + SUCCESSFULLY ADDED Property ShowMode as a Combobox !!!!.

  * vxh1.prg
    * Reverted Ron's change to Path names: Ron please leave the paths they don't bother anybody
      since the application runs from who knows where it is mandatory to set pathnames to libraries
      "[C:\Visual-xHarbour\library\lib\vxh.lib]" and CopyFile( Application:Path+"\Default.res" unless
      you either change the working directory or use Application:Path as a prefix.
      Please don't get me wrong but I couldn't build a test app for 4 hours, it's 2:23am I just found the problem
      please don't CLEAN the code yet it makes me waste time, I know you like things different
      but I work alone at home at night and sometimes I have to struggle for hours because of silly things like that
      Again please don't get me wrong ok ?

      Thanks.

   + Added EventManager See Tab Current Object, below there are 2 TabButtons [ Properties ] [ Events ]

2004-07-18 03:40 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>

   * RE-WROTE Object Inspector to eliminate FLICKER when clicking a control took me 10 hours work but I have it EXACTLY
     like MS Visual Studio even added a thin line under Item Level 0 ( zero ) when compressed.

   * Modified Window logic to control the Window Editor when scrolling

   + Added events OnExitSizeMove / OnEnterSizeMove, OnExitSizeMove() is special for refreshing the Obj Inspector AFTER the form is been
     moved

   + Added BUILD Icon and LOGIC ( Ron, I'm calling external xbuildw based on the file I save, I like it, just need to get rid of the
     result MessageBox, insted I will open a Docked Window ( like all the IDEs ) to show the progress, maybe we could add the code itself
     and make Visual xHarbour a builder.
   + Added PLAY Icon and Logic... Working perfectly, we can build and run from IDE
   * Modified "Choose Font" Button on Object Inspector, now it has no Theme ( looks better because it's too small ) and it looks pressed
     on first click
   * RE-WROTE ToolTip logic, It was VERY WRONG, now it's a PROPERTY for every control NOT A CHILD ( Shows on Object Inspector ).
   * MODIFIED Code generation LOOP, now it is perfect smaller and recursive.

   * FIXED ColorPicker and Object Inspector Back/Forecolor properties to display correct "System Default..."
     when needed instead of "Custom..."

   * Fixes on TreeView control
   * Fixed CoolBar to redraw when sizing, not noticed on some XP themes.
   * Fixed Access to class Font had problems from Object Inspector

   * Modified default GridSize to 6x6 like MSVS

   + Added API: CopyFile, GetLogicalDriveStrings, ShellExecute, WinExec, GetSaveFileName, GetOpenFileName, CreateDirectory,
                CheckRadioButton, BitBlt, CreateBitmap, SetROP2

                NOTE !!!:  I really don't understand why the IDE worked without these functions.

                CreateDirectory is added to WinUTIL.c because it processes structure SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES within the function
                and not in prg level.

   + Added all macro calls to TABCTRL_* functions, more mistery.

   + Added Missing C TreeView macros

   - Removed call to What32.ch
   - Deleted Files What32.ch / Wow.ch
   + Added vxh.ch

2004-07-16 18:46 GMT-8 Augusto Infante <august@xHarbour.com>

   * Renamed Studio*.prg to Vxh*.prg

2004-07-16 10:45 GMT-8 Ron Pinkas <Ron in xHarbour.com>
   * Corrected code generation to use ValToPrgExp()
