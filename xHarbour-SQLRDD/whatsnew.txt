  * Added new method SR_GetConnection():SR_GetnConnection() to retrieve the SQLRDD connection number returnd by SR_AddConnection()
  * New function SR_SetAppUser( [nCnn], cUsername ) used to setup the application username in order to have it filled in log files (like long_qry.dbf) and LogChanges (see below)
  * New function SR_SetAppSite( [nCnn], cSite ) used to setup the application site in order to have it filled in LogChanges table (see below)
  * New function SR_SetConnectionLogChanges( [nCnn], nOpt ) to setup how SQLRDD will log all changes to database to a catalog table.
    Changes are stored in SR_MGMNTLOGCHG table that will be automatically created in your database. The purpose is to keep track of all changes in database so we can push a replicance application or for troublesoting.
    You can find in sqlrdd.ch the options for nOpt parameter:

   #define SQLLOGCHANGES_NOLOG                           0     /* Does not log */
   #define SQLLOGCHANGES_BEFORE_COMMAND                  1     /* May log wrong statements */
   #define SQLLOGCHANGES_AFTER_COMMAND                  10     /* Logs only if command was succefull */
   #define SQLLOGCHANGES_IN_TRANSACTION                100     /* Otherwise log goes by second connection, outside
                                                                  transaction control */
   #define SQLLOGCHANGES_LOCKS                        1000     /* Log Line LOCKS */
   #define SQLLOGCHANGES_DELETE_AFTER_TRANSACTION    10000     /* Delete all previous ocourrences from current
                                                                  database connection when transaction is finished */
   #define SQLLOGCHANGES_LOG_CALLSTACK              100000     /* Log Call Stack - good when looking for locked peers */

   Examples:

   This will log all statements that changes data in your database, doens't matter if it is made via workarea or direct SQL command:
   SR_SetConnectionLogChanges( , SQLLOGCHANGES_AFTER_COMMAND )

   This will log all statements that handles table/record locks, and also log the application call stack, so you may know from what point the lock came from:
   SR_SetConnectionLogChanges( , SQLLOGCHANGES_LOCKS + SQLLOGCHANGES_LOG_CALLSTACK )
